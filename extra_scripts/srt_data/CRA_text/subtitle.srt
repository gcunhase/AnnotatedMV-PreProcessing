1
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,404
Call it in.

2
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,077
Ma'am?

3
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:20,999
Can you hear me?

4
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:23,550
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

5
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:26,589
Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
Jesus.

6
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:33,375
Ma'am, are you hurt?

7
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:36,406
Can you move?
I... I can't breathe.

8
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:42,258
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

9
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,198
It's okay.

10
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,616
Okay. Okay.

11
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,544
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

12
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,646
No!

13
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,563
It's okay.
Get away from me!

14
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:10,625
Get away.
Stay away from me!

15
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,892
Not you! Not you!

16
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,675
It's okay.
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

17
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:20,221
Keep away from me!
Lady, I'm tryin'... I'm tryin' to help you.

18
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:22,744
Fuck you! Not you!

19
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:25,729
Somebody! Anybody else!

20
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:29,336
Please, somebody! Not you!
Stop moving!

21
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,786
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

22
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:36,884
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

23
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:44,621
Okay. Okay.

24
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,513
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

25
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:50,222
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

26
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,241
and that's gasoline there.

27
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,970
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

28
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,174
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

29
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:04,741
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

30
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,767
Yeah. Yeah.

31
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,703
Thanks.

32
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:20,125
Is anything broken?

33
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,558
I-I don't think so.

34
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:25,468
Okay. Then that's good.

35
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,953
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

36
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:31,221
Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

37
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:34,516
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

38
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:41,874
Oh, fuck!

39
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,839
I'm sorry.
That's okay.

40
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,547
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

41
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,653
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

42
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,155
It's okay, it's okay.

43
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:56,771
It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

44
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:59,109
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

45
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,575
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

46
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,426
Everything's gonna be fine.

47
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,658
Ryan!

48
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:56,837
Pull!

49
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,729
It's okay.

50
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,189
It's okay.

51
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:27,597
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

52
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,066
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

53
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:32,080
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

54
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,477
It's cool, it's cool.

55
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,691
Here we go.
All right, you're doin' great.

56
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:11,667
The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

57
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:14,386
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work
none of us would have jobs.

58
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,657
Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
Graham Waters.

59
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:19,473
Thanks for coming in.
He just pulled into the garage.

60
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,570
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

61
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:25,901
Internal Affairs says this Conklin
has two suspicious shootings on his record.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,130
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

63
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,912
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

64
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:35,327
You know any reason why
we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

65
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:40,254
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

66
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:46,019
We found tree hundred thousand dollars in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

67
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,091
Shit!

68
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:52,503
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

69
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:56,349
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

70
00:07:56,446 --> 00:08:00,470
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

71
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:03,570
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

72
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:07,316
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have
known the money was in it.

73
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,589
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

74
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,239
Give us a minute.

75
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,887
No problem.

76
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,194
Who knows about the money?

77
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,237
You gotta be kiddin' me.

78
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:38,051
There are only two people
in this room.

79
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:41,376
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

80
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,840
Jim Ferguson?
Yeah.

81
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:50,523
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

82
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:53,041
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't
clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

83
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,993
And even if it was, we aren't
going to prosecute a dead man.

84
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,310
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

85
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,610
You can do this dance if you want to,

86
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,025
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

87
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:08,978
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

88
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:11,792
Fucking black people, huh?

89
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:13,829
What did you just say?

90
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,853
I mean,

91
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,338
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

92
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:21,410
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

93
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:25,221
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

94
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,207
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

95
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:31,196
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man,

96
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:34,115
they just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

97
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:41,143
Of course, you and I
know that's not the truth.

98
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,156
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

99
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:46,587
And assholes like Lewis keep
feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

100
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,006
What did you say
you did for the D.A. Again?

101
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,992
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

102
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,942
Oh, please, don't do that.

103
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:56,750
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

104
00:09:56,854 --> 00:10:01,074
What do you think those kids need...
to make them believe, to give them hope?

105
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,242
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

106
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:06,159
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

107
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:10,661
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

108
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:15,270
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

109
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:19,110
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

110
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:23,199
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

111
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:26,813
And the right message is,
Look at this black boy I just bought?

112
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:30,361
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

113
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,981
Actually we were thinking of you.

114
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,202
Until we saw that.

115
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:39,253
It's your brother's file.

116
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,357
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

117
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,042
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

118
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,728
Christ, that's a shitty law.

119
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:49,716
There's a warrant in there.

120
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:53,968
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

121
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,511
Fucking black people, huh?

122
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:06,955
So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

123
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,253
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

124
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:12,516
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

125
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:16,192
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

126
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:20,830
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

127
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,809
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

128
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:25,977
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

129
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:28,948
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

130
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,290
was enough to get him killed.

131
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,282
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

132
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:38,613
Which means we
could get this wrong.

133
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,340
Maybe that's what happened with
your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

134
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:47,721
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

135
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,284
You're the one closest to all this.

136
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,107
You need to tell us.

137
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,123
What does your gut tell you?

138
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:13,404
So? Graham?

139
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:15,546
What do I tell 'em?

140
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,390
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

141
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:29,779
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

142
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:32,814
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

143
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,373
Okay.

144
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:53,478
Before I get to why we're here,

145
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:57,383
I know that many of you have heard
we had our car stolen last night.

146
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:01,668
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

147
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,522
But we're okay.

148
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:08,059
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

149
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:13,527
Now, just after nine p.m. last night,
Detective William Lewis,

150
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:16,663
an eight-year veteran of the force
and an active member of the black community,

151
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,903
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

152
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,033
Get outta the car!

153
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:19,923
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

154
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:23,787
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

155
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:25,680
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

156
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,640
Say that again!

157
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:30,761
Say that again!
You stupid motherfucker!

158
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:34,058
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

159
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:36,426
Man, what the fuck? Get off!
Fuck you!

160
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,240
Shoot him!
I'll blow your head off!

161
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,271
Shoot this motherfucker!
I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

162
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:43,456
Stop talkin' and shoot!

163
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,524
Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
Get off of me!

164
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,191
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

165
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,178
Oh, shit.
Anthony! Anthony!

166
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:57,851
Get the fuck outta my car!

167
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,123
Shit! Damn!

168
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,327
What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
Fuck you!

169
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,366
Car twenty five in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

170
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:12,209
I will blow you away!
Get the fuck out of the car!

171
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,685
Go on! Shoot me then!

172
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,504
Two two Ida Tom Adam three...
Oh, Christ!

173
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:26,952
Get the fuck outta the car!
You get the fuck outta the car!

174
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,322
Get outta the fucking car!
It's my fucking car!

175
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:31,689
It's my fucking gun!
Fuck, it's my gun now!

176
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:33,892
Gimme my fucking gun!

177
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:42,624
Fuck!

178
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:48,064
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

179
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:54,675
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

180
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,273
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

181
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,922
Get out of my car.
You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

182
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:10,544
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

183
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,863
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

184
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,271
Lie face down on the ground.

185
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,921
Spread your arms and legs.
No, you lie face down!

186
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,030
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

187
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:34,501
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

188
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:35,491
On your knees now!

189
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,205
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

190
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,924
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

191
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,519
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

192
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:44,761
This man is making threatening gestures.
Threatening gestures?

193
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:47,100
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

194
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,742
I know this man! I know this man!
Get back.

195
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,264
Give me some space. I know this guy.
Get outta the way.

196
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:54,417
Step away.

197
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:56,463
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

198
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,717
Man, don't walk up on me!
See what's happening here?

199
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:02,927
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

200
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,915
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

201
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,466
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

202
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,747
Fuck you!

203
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,012
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

204
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:14,891
'Cause you're the one
whose head's gonna be blown off!

205
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,199
Officer Hanson, step away.

206
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,615
He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking
friend! This man is not armed!

207
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:22,536
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

208
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,574
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

209
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,809
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

210
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,932
You startin' to understand
the situation?

211
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,584
What do you want from me?

212
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:43,027
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

213
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:44,986
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

214
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,221
and do nothing until I speak with these officers.

215
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:50,168
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

216
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:54,123
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

217
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,148
Yeah, I can do that.

218
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,388
Good.

219
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:05,131
I told this man to stay where he is and keep his
hands in plain sight.

220
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:10,050
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

221
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,157
I need this favor.

222
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:16,121
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

223
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,679
I need to let him go
with a warning.

224
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:23,484
What kind of fucking warning?
A harsh warning.

225
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:27,737
Thank you.

226
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:34,351
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

227
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:37,585
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

228
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:41,546
I'm trying to help you.
I didn't ask for your help, did I?

229
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:45,706
Go home.

230
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:51,467
Yeah, that I can do.

231
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:08,605
Look at me.

232
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:12,565
You embarrass me.

233
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,674
You embarrass yourself.

234
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:56,994
Daddy's home!

235
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:17,996
What's up?
Give me my money!

236
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,434
What? What money?
Daddy!

237
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,661
To pay for my store. Give me my money!
Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

238
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:25,189
Give me my money!

239
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:29,637
I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
That's not my truck!

240
00:21:29,774 --> 00:21:32,009
Daddy?
Elizabeth!

241
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:36,197
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got fifty dollars. Here.

242
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:38,271
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

243
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:39,008
Mommy?

244
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:42,237
I'm coming, I'm coming!

245
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:46,365
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

246
00:21:46,468 --> 00:21:50,524
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

247
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,239
Lara, stay outta the street!

248
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:23,239
It's okay, Daddy.
What... What?

249
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,715
I'll protect you.

250
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:53,429
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

251
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:56,432
It's a really good cloak.

252
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:05,478
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

253
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:07,404
Well, you are one to talk.

254
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:11,211
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

255
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:14,568
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

256
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,760
Yes! At them! Yes!

257
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:22,019
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

258
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:25,662
at the dry cleaners who destroyed
another blouse today,

259
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,559
at the gardener who keeps
overwatering the lawn.

260
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:30,778
I...

261
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,388
I just thought that...

262
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:37,875
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

263
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:40,858
and I would feel better, you know?

264
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:44,749
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

265
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:48,628
I realized that it had nothing
to do with my car being stolen.

266
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:54,191
I wake up like this
every morning!

267
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:58,085
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

268
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:01,387
Carol, I don't know why! And I...

269
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,922
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

270
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:07,815
Bye.
