1
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:32,085
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

2
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,520
Games.

3
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,325
One hundred and fifty days
of games.

4
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:48,318
He's cleverer than I thought.

5
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:49,601
Clever.

6
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:52,804
The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him

7
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,082
if they weren't so afraid
of his praetorian.

8
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,123
Fear and wonder
a powerful combination.

9
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:01,285
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

10
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,676
I think he knows what Rome is.

11
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:05,359
Rome is the mob.

12
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:08,883
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

13
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,562
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

14
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:15,036
The beating heart of Rome

15
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:16,958
is not the marble of the senate.

16
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:19,356
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

17
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:22,798
He'll bring them death

18
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,200
and they will love him for it.

19
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:49,724
Spaniard.

20
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:01,880
Are you not entertained?

21
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,126
Are you not entertained?

22
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,876
Is this not why you are here?

23
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:14,726
Spaniard! Spaniard!

24
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,638
What do you want?

25
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,126
Girl?

26
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:40,719
Boy?

27
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,160
You sent for me.

28
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:44,124
Yes, I did.

29
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,801
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

30
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:48,400
You could be magnificent.

31
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,762
I'm required to kill, so I kill.

32
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,326
That is enough.

33
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:55,365
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

34
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,160
The young emperor

35
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,477
has arranged
a series of spectacles

36
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,717
to commemorate his father

37
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:07,082
Marcus Aurelius.

38
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,237
I find that amusing

39
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:11,238
since it was Marcus Aurelius

40
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,921
the wise,
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius

41
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,884
that closed us down.

42
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:22,566
So, finally, after five years
of scratching a living

43
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,002
in flea-infested villages

44
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,318
we're finally going back
to where we belong

45
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:30,238
the Colosseum.

46
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:34,881
Oh, you should see
the Colosseum, Spaniard.

47
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,997
Fifty thousand Romans

48
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:42,795
watching every movement
of your sword

49
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:46,356
willing you to make
that killer blow.

50
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,922
The silence before you strike

51
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:51,918
and the noise afterwards.

52
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,565
It rises.

53
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,478
It rises up like

54
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,878
like a storm

55
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:00,923
as if you were
the thunder god himself.

56
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,838
You were a gladiator?

57
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,440
Yes, I was.

58
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:12,603
You won your freedom?

59
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,996
A long time ago, the emperor

60
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,523
presented me with a rudis.

61
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:21,405
It's just a wooden sword.

62
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,435
The symbol of your freedom.

63
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:30,243
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

64
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,398
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

65
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:37,082
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

66
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,717
You asked me what I want.

67
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:44,680
I, too, want to stand
in front of the emperor

68
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,160
as you did.

69
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,442
Then listen to me.

70
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,119
Learn from me.

71
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:55,359
I wasn't the best
because I killed quickly.

72
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:58,803
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

73
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,718
Win the crowd

74
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,638
and you'll win your freedom.

75
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,158
I will win the crowd.

76
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:13,484
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

77
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:18,083
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

78
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,998
and have bloody adventures

79
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,918
and the great whore
will suckle us

80
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,362
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

81
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:25,846
And then...

82
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,884
when enough men have died

83
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,478
perhaps you will have your freedom.

84
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:40,445
Here. Use this.

85
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,643
It's somewhere out there

86
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,604
my country

87
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,405
my home.

88
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,005
My wife is preparing food.

89
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:15,397
My daughters carry water
from the river.

90
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:17,842
Will I ever see them again?

91
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,764
I think no.

92
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,678
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

93
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,883
I think so.

94
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,878
But then...

95
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,525
I will die soon.

96
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,725
They will not die for many years.

97
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:34,479
I'll have to wait.

98
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,842
But you would wait?

99
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:38,645
Of course.

100
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,680
You see...

101
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,246
my wife...

102
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,518
and my son

103
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,438
are already waiting for me.

104
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,916
You'll meet them again.

105
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,160
But not yet.

106
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:00,844
Not yet, unless

107
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,326
Not yet.

108
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:07,126
Not yet.

109
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,844
There.
There it is.

110
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,166
Out.

111
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,158
Go! Go! Out!

112
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,158
Good to see you again,
old friend.

113
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,080
Bring me fortune.

114
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,724
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

115
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:44,405
I didn't know men
could build such things.

116
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,358
Win the crowd.

117
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,597
Get inside! Move!

118
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,040
Inside!

119
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:48,840
He sleeps so well
because he's loved.

120
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,365
Come, brother. It's late.

121
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:59,883
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

122
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,125
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

123
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:09,238
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

124
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:18,526
Drink this tonic.

125
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:30,799
I think the time is almost right.

126
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,923
I could announce
the dissolution of the senate...

127
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:34,838
at the celebration
to honor our father.

128
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,758
Do you think I should?

129
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,798
Are the people ready?

130
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,324
I think you need your rest now.

131
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,278
Will you stay with me?

132
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,244
Still afraid of the dark,
brother?

133
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,726
Still.

134
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,640
Always.

135
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,920
Stay with me tonight.
You know I won't.

136
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,566
Then kiss me.

137
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:24,480
Sleep, brother.

138
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,086
Come on!

139
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,606
Take me.

140
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,516
All right, that's enough.

141
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:18,805
The emperor wants battles, and I don't
want to sacrifice my best fighters.

142
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:22,436
The crowd wants battles,
so the emperor gives them battles.

143
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:25,997
And you get the battle of Carthage.
The massacre of Carthage.

144
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:31,004
Why don't you go down to the prison,
round up all the beggars and thieves?

145
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,679
We've done that.

146
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,884
If you want to give away the best
gladiators in the whole of the empire

147
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,276
then I want double the rates.

148
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,882
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract canceled.

149
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,366
You don't like it?

150
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,723
Then you can crawl back down
that shithole that you came from.

151
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,959
Cassius, please!
Cassius!

152
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,485
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

153
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:24,761
Yes.

154
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:28,367
They said you were a giant.

155
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,517
They said you could crush
a man's skull with one hand.

156
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,757
A man's? No.

157
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,525
A boy's.

158
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:40,720
They have good horses in Spain?
Some of the best.

159
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,638
This is Argento

160
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:45,558
and this is Scarto.

161
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,478
They were my horses.

162
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,563
They were taken from me.

163
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:54,196
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.

164
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,802
They let you watch the games?
My uncle says it makes me strong.

165
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:01,038
And what does your father say?
My father is dead.

166
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:04,563
Master Lucius, it is time.

167
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,001
I have to go.

168
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:08,600
Your name is Lucius?

169
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,441
Lucius Verus, after my father.

170
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:44,399
Lower!

171
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:50,999
Claudius!

172
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:52,884
Yes?
More shields!

173
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,678
When the emperor enters

174
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,406
raise your weapons, salute him

175
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,318
and then speak together.

176
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,595
Face the emperor

177
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,599
and don't turn your back on him.

178
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:27,918
Go, and die with honor.

179
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,238
Hail, mighty Caesar!

180
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:26,559
Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar! Caesar!

181
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,887
We who are about to die
salute you!

182
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,965
On this day

183
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:42,437
we reach back
to hallowed antiquity

184
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,358
to bring you a re-creation

185
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,122
of the second fall
of mighty Carthage!

186
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:56,596
On the barren plain of Zama

187
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,884
there stood the invincible armies

188
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,162
of the barbarian Hannibal.

189
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:06,125
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors

190
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,767
from all brute nations

191
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:11,725
bent on merciless

192
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,798
destruction

193
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,525
conquest.

194
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:17,518
Your emperor

195
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:19,484
is pleased to give you

196
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,206
the barbarian horde!

197
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,564
Anyone here been in the army?

198
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:35,480
Yes.
I served with you at Vindobona.

199
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,205
You can help me.

200
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,084
Whatever comes out of these gates

201
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,080
we've got a better chance of survival
if we work together.

202
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:48,078
Do you understand?

203
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:52,086
If we stay together, we survive.

204
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,476
The emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

205
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,400
of Scipio Africanus!

206
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:10,197
To the death!

207
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,678
Kill! Kill! Kill!

208
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,880
Stay close!

209
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,244
Come together!

210
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,323
Staggered columns!
Staggered columns!

211
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,759
- Soon all your men will be slain.
- You don't have a chance.

212
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,886
Lock your shields!
Stay as one!

213
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,200
Hold!

214
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,720
Hold!

215
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,035
As one!

216
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,685
Well done!

217
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,240
Hold!

218
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,885
Down low! Down low!

219
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:35,796
Yes!

220
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:48,921
Hagen!

221
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:15,437
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

222
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,599
Quickly!

223
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:23,326
Get out there!
Hurry!

224
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:03,957
Maximus!

225
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,878
Single column!
Single column!

226
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,000
We win!

227
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:11,198
My history's a little hazy,
Cassius

228
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:14,085
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

229
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,998
Yes, sire.

230
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:18,601
Forgive me, sire.

231
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:22,236
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

232
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:23,680
Who is he?

233
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:27,316
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

234
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,805
I think I'll meet him.
Yes, sire.

235
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,998
Hail to the barbarians!

236
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:53,763
Forward! Arms at ready!

237
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:07,595
Drop your weapons.

238
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:15,119
Gladiator,
the emperor has asked for you.

239
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:17,084
I am at the emperor's service.

240
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:45,123
Rise. Rise.

241
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,357
Your fame is well deserved,
Spaniard.

242
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:59,325
I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.

243
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:03,002
As for this young man, he insists you
are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules?

244
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:08,122
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

245
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:11,605
You do have a name?

246
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:14,683
My name is Gladiator.

247
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:19,876
How dare you show
your back to me?

248
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,366
Slave!

249
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:25,279
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

250
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,563
My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius

251
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,877
commander of
the armies of the north

252
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,606
general of the Felix Legions

253
00:25:43,687 --> 00:25:46,838
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius

254
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:50,436
father to a murdered son

255
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,995
husband to a murdered wife

256
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,636
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

257
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,918
Arms!

258
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,966
Live! Live! Live! Live!

259
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:08,275
Guards, at rest!

260
00:27:56,687 --> 00:28:00,885
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

261
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,318
Why is he still alive?

262
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,558
I don't know.

263
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,638
He shouldn't be alive.

264
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:35,080
It vexes me.

265
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,598
I'm terribly vexed.

266
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,004
I did what I had to do.

267
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:55,880
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

268
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,844
You do see that?

269
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,684
What did you feel
when you saw him?

270
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,598
I felt nothing.

271
00:29:12,287 --> 00:29:14,517
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

272
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:17,558
No more than I wounded him.

273
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:23,958
They lied to me in Germania.

274
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,798
They told me he was dead.

275
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,161
If they lie to me,
they don't respect me.

276
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:35,045
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

277
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,358
Then you must
let the legions know

278
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:40,480
their treachery

279
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,683
will not go unpunished.

280
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,120
Poor sister.

281
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:47,156
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

282
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,561
What will you do?

283
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,122
This way.
