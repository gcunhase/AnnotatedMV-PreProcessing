1
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:19,572
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

2
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:32,927
Minas Tirith.

3
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,687
City of kings.

4
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,531
Make way!

5
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:37,285
It's the tree.

6
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:39,045
Gandalf. Gandalf.

7
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,408
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

8
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,291
The tree of the king.

9
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:45,887
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

10
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,767
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

11
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:52,843
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

12
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:57,002
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

13
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:00,763
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

14
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:04,252
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

15
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:09,722
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

16
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:44,888
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

17
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:54,689
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

18
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:58,850
Perhaps you come to explain this.

19
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:08,610
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

20
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,405
Boromir died to save us...

21
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,131
...my kinsman and me.

22
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:30,649
He fell defending us from many foes.
Pippin.

23
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,243
I offer you my service, such as it is...

24
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:42,532
in payment of this debt.

25
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,645
Get up.

26
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:50,204
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

27
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:52,365
but it is not now.

28
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:55,169
War is coming.

29
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:59,725
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

30
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:03,852
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

31
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:08,723
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

32
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:13,205
Send word to Theoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

33
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:18,083
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

34
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:21,211
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

35
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:27,246
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

36
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:30,371
I have seen more than you know.

37
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,570
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

38
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,531
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

39
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,242
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

40
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:46,090
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

41
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:50,929
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

42
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:55,405
last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

43
00:04:55,573 --> 00:05:01,125
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

44
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:05,571
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

45
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,251
Come.

46
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:28,211
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

47
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:32,446
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

48
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:37,084
Do they?
You're in the service of the steward now.

49
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:43,408
You're going to have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took, guard of the Citadel.

50
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,482
It's so quiet.

51
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:52,771
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

52
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:56,612
I don't want to be in a battle...

53
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:02,203
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

54
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,088
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

55
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,325
There never was much hope.

56
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,726
Just a fool's hope.

57
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,252
Our enemy is ready.

58
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,927
His full strength's gathered.

59
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:31,449
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

60
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:34,525
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

61
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,287
mercenaries from the coast.

62
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,921
All will answer Mordor's call.

63
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:41,572
Come on.

64
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,844
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

65
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:49,244
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

66
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:54,325
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

67
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:58,008
the last defense of this city
will be gone.

68
00:06:58,173 --> 00:07:02,052
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

69
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,251
Gandalf?

70
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:16,288
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

71
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:20,402
the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

72
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:25,567
The one they say no living man can kill.

73
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,603
The Witch-king of Angmar.

74
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:31,888
You've met him before.

75
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,001
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

76
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,887
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

77
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,688
the greatest of the Nine.

78
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:49,970
Minas Morgul is his lair.

79
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:57,043
The Dead City.

80
00:07:57,213 --> 00:08:02,207
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

81
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,203
Quick. Quick.

82
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:15,207
They will see. They will see.

83
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:29,167
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

84
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:33,042
The way into Mordor.

85
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,365
The secret stair.

86
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,048
Climb.

87
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:02,132
No, Mr. Frodo!
Not that way!

88
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:09,241
What's it doing?
No.

89
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:12,644
They're calling me.
No.

90
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,926
Hide! Hide!

91
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:28,451
I can feel his blade.

92
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,690
We come to it at last.

93
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:46,166
The great battle of our time.

94
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,850
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

95
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:39,205
The board is set.

96
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:41,807
The pieces are moving.

97
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:45,412
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

98
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:50,010
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

99
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:56,132
You must not fail me.

100
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:38,047
Quiet.

101
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:41,570
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Go.

102
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,007
Come on.

103
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:47,491
Faster.

104
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,363
Draw swords.

105
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,161
Hold! Hold!

106
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,965
What?

107
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,811
Amon Din.

108
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:37,885
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

109
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:45,046
Hope is kindled.

110
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:17,845
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

111
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:21,527
Gondor calls for aid.

112
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:33,406
And Rohan will answer.

113
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,492
Muster the Rohirrim.

114
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:52,844
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

115
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:57,245
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

116
00:17:57,413 --> 00:18:02,441
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

117
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,647
Forward.
Very good, sir.

118
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,087
Gamling.
My lord.

119
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,811
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

120
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:09,964
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

121
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,169
I will.

122
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:18,650
Will you ride with us?
Just to the encampment.

123
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:22,522
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

124
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:30,690
The men have found their captain.

125
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:34,050
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

126
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,681
You have given us hope.

127
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:53,803
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

128
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:57,727
the doom of our time will be decided.

129
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:05,486
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

130
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:09,089
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

131
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:52,284
Faramir!

132
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:01,888
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

133
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:05,371
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

134
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,968
Nazgul.

135
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,602
Take cover!

136
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:23,162
Nazgul!

137
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,848
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

138
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:34,970
Fall back!

139
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:46,124
Retreat! Retreat!
Come on!

140
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:13,565
The age of Men is over.

141
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:19,091
The time of the Orc has come.

142
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:23,603
Take cover!

143
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:27,448
Take cover, my lord!

144
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,007
It's coming!

145
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:37,570
It's Mithrandir.
The White Rider!

146
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:17,246
Pull!

147
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:36,522
Mithrandir.

148
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,365
They broke through our defenses.

149
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,649
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

150
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:45,692
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

151
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:50,210
Long has he foreseen this doom.
Foreseen and done nothing.

152
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,762
Faramir?

153
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:01,288
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

154
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:03,569
No.

155
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,332
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

156
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:10,449
Where? When?
In ithilien.

157
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:12,604
Not two days ago.

158
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:17,331
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

159
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:20,521
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

160
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,921
What does that mean?

161
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:29,803
What's wrong?
Faramir, tell me everything.

162
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:58,846
Careful, master. Careful.

163
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:02,164
Very far to fall.

164
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:08,087
Very dangerous are the stairs.

165
00:24:10,693 --> 00:24:13,082
Come, master.

166
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:21,685
Come to Smeagol.

167
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:29,252
Mr. Frodo.

168
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:31,652
Get back, you!

169
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:33,929
Don't touch him!

170
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,612
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

171
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:44,322
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

172
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,768
Master?

173
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,843
Master carries heavy burden.

174
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:56,212
Smeagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

175
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:59,490
Fat one cannot know.

176
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:04,126
Smeagol look after master.

177
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,369
He wants it.

178
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:11,890
He needs it.
Smeagol sees it in his eye.

179
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:17,286
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

180
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:21,162
The fat one will take it from you.

181
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:32,291
Send forth all legions.

182
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:36,287
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

183
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:39,965
Slay them all.

184
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:47,125
What of the wizard?
I will break him.

185
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:52,648
What of Theoden's riders?

186
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:55,327
Will Rohan's army come?

187
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:57,609
Mithrandir.

188
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:02,367
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

189
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:06,688
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

190
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:08,286
in peace or war...

191
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:11,248
in living or dying...

192
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,727
from...

193
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:19,012
From this hour henceforth...

194
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:21,004
until my lord release me...

195
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:24,569
or death take me.

196
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:27,482
And I shall not forget it...

197
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,929
nor fail to reward
that which is given.

198
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:40,408
Fealty with love.

199
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,005
Valour with honour.

200
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:47,770
Disloyalty with vengeance.

201
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:59,966
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

202
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,772
defenses that your brother
long held intact.

203
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:05,322
What would you have me do?
I will not yield...

204
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:08,132
the river in Pelennor unfought.

205
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,885
Osgiliath must be retaken.

206
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:12,044
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

207
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:15,332
Much must be risked in war.

208
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:21,681
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

209
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,770
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

210
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:34,372
that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

211
00:27:37,693 --> 00:27:39,331
Yes.

212
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:42,129
I wish that.

213
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:52,562
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

214
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,086
I will do what I can
in his stead.

215
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,245
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

216
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:14,689
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

217
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:36,843
What are you up to?

218
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:38,207
Sneaking off, are we?

219
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:40,611
Sneaking?

220
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,683
Sneaking?

221
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:48,090
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

222
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:53,122
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

223
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,329
and they say "sneak."

224
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:58,441
Sneak?

225
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:01,652
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

226
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:04,281
Very nice, very nice.
All right. All right!

227
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:07,649
You just startled me is all.

228
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,885
What were you doing?

229
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:13,489
Sneaking.

230
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,765
Fine. Have it your own way.

231
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:21,362
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

232
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,610
We have to be moving on.

233
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:30,052
It's dark still.

234
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,363
It's always dark here.

235
00:30:36,453 --> 00:30:38,284
It's gone!

236
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:42,206
The Elven bread.
What?

237
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,772
That's all we have left.

238
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:50,042
He took it. He must have!

239
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,684
Smeagol?
No, no, not poor Smeagol.

240
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,606
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

241
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:59,845
You're a lying wretch!
What did you do with it?!

242
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,492
He doesn't eat it.

243
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,683
He can't have taken it.
Look.

244
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,445
What's this?

245
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:13,210
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

246
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:15,485
He took it.

247
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:20,286
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

248
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:22,205
That's a filthy lie!

249
00:31:22,373 --> 00:31:24,489
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

250
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:25,847
Sam!
Call me...

251
00:31:26,013 --> 00:31:27,207
Stop it!

252
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:29,327
Sam!

253
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:34,048
I'll kill him!
Sam! No!

254
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:40,371
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

255
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:42,569
Here, just...
Let's just rest a bit.

256
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,724
I'm all right.
No.

257
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:47,851
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

258
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:50,049
It's that Gollum.

259
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:51,851
It's this place.

260
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,481
It's that thing around your neck.

261
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:59,081
I could help a bit.

262
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,813
I could carry it for a while.

263
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:03,645
Carry it for a while.

264
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:05,007
I could carry it... I could carry it.

265
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:07,569
Share the load... Share the load...
the load... the load.

266
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,207
Get away!

267
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:13,852
I don't want to keep it.

268
00:32:17,253 --> 00:32:19,164
I just want to help.

269
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,641
See? See?

270
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:27,123
He wants it for himself.

271
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:28,931
Shut up, you!

272
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:31,210
Go away!
Get out of here!

273
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:33,125
No, Sam.

274
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:34,487
It's you.

275
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,125
I'm sorry, Sam.

276
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:43,087
But he's a liar.

277
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,813
He's poisoned you against me.

278
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,004
You can't help me anymore.

279
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,690
You don't mean that.

280
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:56,811
Go home.

281
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,291
Faramir!

282
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,250
Faramir!

283
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:20,689
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

284
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:23,769
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

285
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,688
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

286
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:34,529
Your father loves you, Faramir.

287
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:38,085
He will remember it
before the end.

288
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,332
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

289
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,526
Well...

290
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:52,611
yes.

291
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:56,882
At least, well enough
for my own people.

292
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:00,762
But we have no songs
for great halls...

293
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:02,961
and evil times.

294
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:06,810
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

295
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:10,846
Come, sing me a song.

296
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,644
Home is behind

297
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:28,408
The world ahead

298
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:36,290
And there are many paths to tread

299
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:41,443
Through shadow

300
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:45,572
To the edge of night

301
00:36:47,213 --> 00:36:52,082
Until the stars are all alight

302
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:59,125
Mist and shadow

303
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:03,411
Cloud and shade

304
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:08,890
All shall fade

305
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:15,007
All shall

306
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,808
Fade
