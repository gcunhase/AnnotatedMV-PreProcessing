1
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,760
Get in.
Hurry.

2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,839
They're following us.

3
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,799
Who's-
Who's following us?

4
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,439
The drop has been
compromised.

5
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,319
Get down!

6
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,319
Stay down.

7
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,040
Here, take this.
I ain't shooting anybody.

8
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,720
Take the goddamn gun!
No!

9
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,319
Son of a

10
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,279
You stay back.
Don't move.

11
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,479
John?

12
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,839
Hi.

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,799
Where were you?

14
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:42,479
Sol-
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

15
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,080
He said you left
the office hours ago.

16
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:49,919
Why didn't you
call me?

17
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Are you all right?

18
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,279
Honey?

19
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,319
John...

20
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,319
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

21
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,560
John,
open the door.

22
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,040
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

23
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,999
Talk to me!

24
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,479
John!

25
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,479
Open the door!

26
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,120
Watch for cars, kids.

27
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,839
John.

28
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,240
William.

29
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,520
This is not what
I signed on for.

30
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
Every time
a car backfires
or a door slams-

31
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,200
I understand-
better than you
could possibly imagine.

32
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,919
You need
to calm down, John.

33
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,520
Now listen to me.
We're closing in
on the bomb,

34
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,879
in large part
due to your work.

35
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,479
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

36
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
William, my circumstance
has changed.

37
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,560
Alicia's pregnant.

38
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,479
I told you attachments
were dangerous.

39
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,399
You chose to marry
the girl.

40
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,919
I did nothing
to prevent it.

41
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,919
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

42
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,080
is for you to continue
your work.

43
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
Well, I'll just quit.

44
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,439
You won't.

45
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,040
Why would I not?

46
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

47
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,799
You quit
working for me,

48
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,439
I quit working for you.

49
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Parcher!

50
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
Parcher!

51
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,919
John, you all right?

52
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,200
John?

53
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,799
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

54
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,999
Why would you
do that?

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,680
Why would you
turn the light on?

56
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,160
What is wrong
with you?

57
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,040
You have to go
to your sister's.

58
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,640
I left the car out the back.
You take Commonwealth.

59
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,640
No side streets,
you stay where it's crowded.
John, I'm not going anywhere!

60
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,040
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

61
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,120
No, I'm not going.
Just get your things.

62
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,640
I'm not leaving-
Stop! Stop it!

63
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,200
Please, Alicia.

64
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,399
I'll explain
when I can.

65
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,799
Uncle John!

66
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,879
Uncle John!

67
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,319
Hey, baby girl!

68
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,080
Wow, someone
needed a hug!

69
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,640
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

70
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,839
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture...

71
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,959
by the inimitable
John Nash?"

72
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,760
What's wrong?

73
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:07,720
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

74
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

75
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,720
Professor Nash!

76
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,919
Welcome!

77
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,279
After?

78
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,640
So, we see that
the- the zeroes,

79
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,200
of the Reimann
Zeta function,

80
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,879
correspond
to singularities...

81
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,080
in space-time,

82
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,919
singularities
in space-time-

83
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,439
and conventional
number theory...

84
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:49,640
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

85
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,399
Sometimes
our expectations...

86
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,799
are betrayed
by the numbers.

87
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,760
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

88
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,279
rational value.

89
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:35,359
Professor Nash!

90
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,240
Hold it!
Professor Nash?

91
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,279
Professor Nash,

92
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,640
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

93
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,640
What do you want?

94
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,240
My name is Rosen,

95
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,200
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

96
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,240
Forgive me
if I don't seem
persuaded.

97
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:06,879
I'd like you
to come with me, John.

98
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
Just for a chat.

99
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,640
It appears I have
no choice.

100
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,080
Oh oh!

101
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,399
Help me!
Somebody!

102
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
Somebody!

103
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,120
Help me!
Get off me!

104
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,399
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

105
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,080
No, no, no,
no, don't.

106
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,919
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

107
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,760
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

108
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,240
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

109
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,999
Get away from me.

110
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
Stay away from me!

111
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,319
There, now.

112
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,160
All better.

113
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,799
Everything's
all right here.

114
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,560
Watch your head.

115
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
John?

116
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
Can you hear me?

117
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,760
Go easy now.

118
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,600
Thorazine takes
a little while
to wear off.

119
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,760
Sorry about
the restraints.

120
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,279
You've got one hell
of a right hook.

121
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,359
Where am l?

122
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,999
Ahem.

123
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,319
MacArthur
Psychiatric Hospital.

124
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,919
I find that
highly unlikely.

125
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,399
You made
a mistake.

126
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:23,240
My work is non-military
in application.

127
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,680
Which work
is that, John?

128
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,479
I don't know
anything.

129
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,999
There's no good
in keeping secrets, you know.

130
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,720
Charles?

131
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
Charles?

132
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,080
I didn't mean to get you
involved in this.

133
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,120
I'm- I'm sorry.

134
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,560
Charles?

135
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:14,799
The prodigal roommate
revealed.

136
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,640
"Saw my name
on the lecture slate."

137
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,760
You lying son
of a bitch!

138
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,439
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

139
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,999
How do you say,
"Charles Herman" in Russian?

140
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,439
How do you say it
in Russian?

141
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,680
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

142
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,200
He's right there.
He's right there.

143
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,240
Stop!
I don't know anything!

144
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,879
Stop!
l I don't know anything!

145
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,959
My name is John Nash.

146
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm being held
against my will.

147
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,080
Somebody call
the Department of Defense.

148
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,879
My name is John Nash.

149
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,319
I'm being held
against my will!

150
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,560
What's wrong with him?

151
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,279
John has
schizophrenia.

152
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:09,959
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

153
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,200
But 
But his work.

154
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,439
He deals
with conspiracies.

155
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
Yes, yes, I know.

156
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,640
In John's world,
these behaviors
are accepted,

157
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,279
encouraged.

158
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,640
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated...

159
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,399
far longer
than is typical.

160
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,919
What do you mean?
How long?

161
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,040
Possibly since
graduate school?

162
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,240
At least that's when
his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

163
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,520
What are you
talking about?
What hallucinations?

164
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,720
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

165
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,080
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

166
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,439
Charles
isn't imaginary.

167
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,999
He and John
have been best friends
since Princeton.

168
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,919
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

169
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,760
He's always in town
for so little time,
lecturing.

170
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,479
Was he at your wedding?
He had to teach.

171
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,120
Have you ever
seen a picture of him,

172
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,640
talked to him
on the telephone?
This is ridiculous.

173
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,839
I phoned Princeton.

174
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,640
According to their
housing records,

175
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,520
John lived alone.

176
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,640
Now, which is more likely-
that your husband,

177
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,879
a mathematician
with no military training,

178
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,279
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians-

179
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,919
You're making him
sound crazy.

180
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:27,080
or, that he has
lost his grip on reality?

181
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,080
Now the only way
I can help him

182
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,399
is to show him
the difference

183
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:35,120
between what's real

184
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,279
and what is in his mind.

185
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,640
Come on.

186
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,480
What's he been
working on?

187
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,360
His work
is classified.

188
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,600
He mentioned
a supervisor

189
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,039
by the name
of William Parcher.

190
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,999
Maybe Mister. Parcher
can clarify things
for us.

191
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,440
But I can't get to him
without clearances.

192
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,879
You want me to help you get...

193
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,879
the details
of my husband's work?

194
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,280
John thinks
I'm a Russian spy.

195
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,239
Is that what
you think?

196
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,079
What did
the doctor say?
Is he sick?

197
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,680
I don't know.

198
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,560
I want to see what John's
been working on.

199
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,480
You know you can't
go in his office.
It's classified, Alicia.

200
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,440
Stop. Oh!

201
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,039
Oh, my God.

202
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,839
Oh, my God.

203
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
Why didn't you
say something?

204
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,320
Alicia,
John's always been

205
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,640
a little weird.

206
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,839
He said he was
doing code-breaking,

207
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,959
that it was eyes-only.

208
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,919
Top secret, part
of the military effort.
Was he?

209
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,360
Well,
it was possible,
you know?

210
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,799
Directives come down
all the time

211
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,199
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

212
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,640
It was possible.
Possible, but

213
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,400
not likely.

214
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,720
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated

215
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,839
and then
when you called

216
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,400
So, is this all
he's been doing
every day?

217
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
Cutting out
magazines?

218
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,799
Well, not all.

219
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,999
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

220
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,079
I missed you.
I missed you.

221
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,280
I have to talk
to you.

222
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,320
Okay.

223
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,280
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

224
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,799
and I do realize
that my behavior...

225
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:16,839
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you...

226
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,239
must have appeared
insane.

227
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,440
I left you
with no other choice.

228
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,560
I do understand...

229
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,400
and I'm truly sorry.
That's okay.

230
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,879
Everything's
gonna be all right.

231
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,400
Everything's
gonna be all right.

232
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,280
We just have to talk quietly.

233
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,799
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

234
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,320
I'm gonna tell you
everything now.

235
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,760
It's breaking
with protocol

236
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,680
but you need
to know,

237
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,440
because you
have to help me
get out of here.

238
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,959
I've been doing
top secret work
for the government.

239
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,720
There's a threat
that exists

240
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,320
of catastrophic
proportions.

241
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,159
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.

242
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,480
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

243
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,799
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me...

244
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:11,079
from doing my work.
You have to get to Wheeler.

245
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,119
You have to find
William Parcher.
Stop.

246
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:15,999
He can help us.
Stop. Stop. Stop!

247
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,280
I went to Wheeler.

248
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,919
Good, good.

249
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:25,959
There is no
William Parcher.

250
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:28,199
Of course there is.

251
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,239
I've been working for him.
Doing what?

252
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Breaking codes?

253
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Dropping packages
in a secret mailbox

254
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
for the government
to pick up?

255
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,560
How could you
know that?

256
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,680
Sol followed you.

257
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,079
He thought it
was harmless.
Sol followed me?

258
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,320
They've never
been opened.

259
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:01,480
It isn't real.

260
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,640
There is
no conspiracy, John.

261
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:09,600
There is
no William Parcher.

262
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,959
It's in your mind.

263
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,959
Do you
understand, baby?

264
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:20,560
You're sick.

265
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
You're sick, John.

266
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,239
John!

267
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,119
John!

268
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,720
Code red.

269
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,159
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

270
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,640
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

271
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,400
John?

272
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:00,799
John?

273
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,879
The implant has gone.

274
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,799
I can't find it.

275
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,400
It's gone.

276
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,239
You see, the nightmare
of schizophrenia...

277
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,560
is not knowing
what's true.

278
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,039
Imagine

279
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,119
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places

280
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:57,039
and the moments
most important to you

281
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,520
were not gone, not dead,

282
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,959
but worse

283
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,879
had never been.

284
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,159
What kind of hell
would that be?

285
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,999
Administering
insulin.

286
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,199
eight forty two AM.

287
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,640
How often?

288
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,959
Five times a week
for ten weeks.

289
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,600
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

290
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,320
And Hansen is running
the department now.

291
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,959
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

292
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,280
Yeah.

293
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,480
John won't come near
the campus, though.

294
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,360
I think he's ashamed.

295
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,280
Hey. Hey.

296
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,360
Want this?

297
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,919
So, Alicia, how-
how are you holding up?

298
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:10,640
Well, the delusions
have passed.

299
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,879
They're saying
with the medication...

300
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,480
and low stress
environment-

301
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,239
No, l I mean,
how are you?

302
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,400
I think often
what I feel

303
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,560
is obligation.

304
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,720
Or guilt
over wanting to leave.

305
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:39,999
Rage against John,
against God and-

306
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,239
But

307
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,280
then I look at him

308
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,919
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

309
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,680
And he becomes that man.

310
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,959
He's transformed
into someone that I love.

311
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:06,239
And I'm transformed
into someone who loves him.

312
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,919
It's not all the time,

313
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,680
but

314
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,400
it's enough.

315
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,320
I think John is
a very lucky man

316
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,999
Alicia.

317
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
So unlucky.

318
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,919
This is us. This is it?

319
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:34,600
It's nice.
It's near where I work.

320
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,039
John? You've a visitor.

321
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,480
Hi.

322
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,039
Hi.

323
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,919
I hope it's okay.

324
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,600
Hey ya, chief.

325
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,440
Cigarette?
Ah, no, thanks.

326
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
I quit, actually.

327
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,280
Hello.
Hey, John.

328
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,999
Have you met
Harvey?

329
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,440
Umm, l

330
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,600
John, there's no
Relax, it's okay.

331
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,199
There's no point
in being nuts if you can't
have a little fun.

332
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,159
Jesus Christ, John.

333
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,799
I should have known.

334
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,999
Here you go.

335
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,320
I can take those later.

336
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,879
You're supposed
to take them now.

337
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:32,400
Can I bring you something?
I'm okay.

338
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,919
Okay.

339
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,239
So, um yeah.
I- I was in town

340
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,360
giving a workshop.

341
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
I go back tonight.

342
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,600
You know, Bender,
he really wanted

343
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,999
to stop by
and you know, see you.
You know, say hi.

344
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,680
Squeamish?

345
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,079
Yeah.

346
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,520
I suppose
I would be, too.

347
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,480
But alas,
I'm stuck with me.

348
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,879
I'm trying to solve
the Reimann hypothesis.
Uh huh.

349
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,199
Oh, yeah?

350
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,280
I figured if
if I dazzle them,

351
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,440
they will have
to reinstate me.

352
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,320
But it's difficult
with the medication,

353
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,680
because it's hard to

354
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,159
see the solution.

355
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,039
You know, John,
you should go easy.

356
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,959
There are other
things besides

357
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,280
besides work.

358
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,640
What are they?

359
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,760
Shh

360
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,600
Shh.

361
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,079
What are you
thinking about?

362
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,959
What do people do?

363
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,360
It's life, John.

364
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,320
Activities available,

365
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,879
just add meaning.

366
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:42,079
You could try
leaving the house.

367
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,440
You know, maybe

368
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,520
talk to people.

369
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,199
You could try
taking out the garbage.

370
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,959
And there's some more
there's some more in

371
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,199
Who Who were
you talking to?

372
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,239
Garbage man.

373
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:45,600
Garbage men don't come
at night.

374
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:50,199
I guess around here
they do.

375
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,440
Sorry.
