1
00:00:01,911 --> 00:00:03,634
Pop.
Six.

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:05,456
Squish.
Uh-uh.

3
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:07,149
Cicero.

4
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:08,917
Lipschitz.

5
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:20,943
He had it coming
He had it coming

6
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:24,688
He only had himself to blame

7
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:28,083
If you'd been there
If you'd seen it

8
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,218
I betcha you would
have done the same

9
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:32,113
Pop.
Six.

10
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:33,074
Squish.
Uh-uh.

11
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,732
Cicero.
Lipschitz!

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,662
Pop.
Six.

13
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:36,811
Squish.
Uh-uh.

14
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,902
Cicero.
Lipschitz!

15
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:42,030
You know how people have these
little habits that get you down?

16
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:46,131
Like Bernie.
Bernie liked to chew gum.

17
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:49,526
No, not chew. Pop.

18
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:52,366
So I came home this one day,
and I am really irritated...

19
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:55,633
and I'm looking for a little bit
of sympathy, and there's Bernie...

20
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,450
lying on the couch, drinking
a beer and chewing.

21
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:01,612
No, not chewing. Poping.

22
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:06,550
So, I said to him, I said,
"You pop that gum one more time..."

23
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,773
And he did. So I took
the shotgun off the wall...

24
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:17,361
and I fired two warning
shots into his head.

25
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,076
He had it coming
He had it coming

26
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,232
He only had himself to blame

27
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,912
If you'd been there
If you'd heard it

28
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:32,341
I betcha you would
have done the same

29
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:42,192
I met Ezekiel Young from Salt
Lake City about two years ago...

30
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:46,097
and he told me he was single,
and we hit it off right away.

31
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:50,093
So we started living together.
He'd go to work, he'd come home.

32
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:52,598
I'd fix him a drink,
we'd have dinner.

33
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,450
And then I found out.

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,644
"Single" he told me?
Single my ass.

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,637
Not only was he married,
no, he had six wives.

36
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:05,649
One of those Mormons,
you know.

37
00:02:05,848 --> 00:02:08,084
So that night when he
came home from work...

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,444
I fixed him his
drink as usual.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,429
You know, some guys just
can't hold their arsenic.

40
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:20,052
He had it coming
He had it coming

41
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:23,597
He took a flower in its prime

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
And then he used it
And he abused it

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,354
It was a murder
but not a crime

44
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:35,126
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
carving up a chicken for dinner...

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,925
minding my own business. In storms
my husband Wilbur, in a jealous rage.

46
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,935
You been screwing the milkman,
he says. He was crazy.

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,167
And he kept on screaming.
You been screwing the milkman!

48
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:51,570
And then he ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife 1O times.

49
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:57,076
If you'd been there
If you'd seen it

50
00:02:57,497 --> 00:03:00,497
I betcha you would
have done the same

51
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,058
Yeah, but did you do it?

52
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:26,323
Uh-uh, not guilty!

53
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:30,355
He had it coming

54
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,166
My sister Veronica and
I had this double act...

55
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,987
and my husband, Charlie,
traveled around with us.

56
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:39,480
For the last number in our act,
we did this twenty acrobatic tricks in a row.

57
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,842
One, two, three, four, five.

58
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,002
Splits, spread eagles, back flips,
flip flops, one right after the other.

59
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,006
So this one night before the show
we're down at the hotel Cicero...

60
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,846
the three of us boozing
and havin' a few laughs...

61
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:57,457
and we ran out of ice,
so I go out to get some.

62
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:00,656
I come back, open the door...

63
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:04,567
and there's Veronica and
Charlie doing number seventeen...

64
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:07,702
the spread eagle.

65
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:11,411
Well, I was in such a state of shock.
I completely blacked out.

66
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,551
I can't remember a thing.

67
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,616
It wasn't until later, when I was
washing the blood off my hands...

68
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,443
I even knew they were dead.

69
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,125
They had it coming
They had it coming

70
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,829
They had it coming all along

71
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,408
I didn't do it
She didn't do it

72
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,457
But if I'd done it
But if she'd done it

73
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,879
How could you tell
me that I was wrong?

74
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,361
They had it coming
They had it coming

75
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,154
They had it coming
They had it coming

76
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:42,966
They had it coming all along

77
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,813
I didn't do it
But if I'd done it

78
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,841
How could you tell me
that I was wrong?

79
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:53,594
I loved Alvin Lipschitz more
than I can possibly say.

80
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:58,096
He was a real artistic guy,
sensitive, a painter.

81
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,629
But he was always
trying to find himself.

82
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:03,925
He'd go out every night looking
for himself and, on the way...

83
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,793
he found Ruth, Gladys,
Rosemary...

84
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:09,202
and Irving.

85
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:12,597
I guess you could say we broke up
because of artistic differences.

86
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:16,983
He saw himself as alive,
and I saw him dead.

87
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:20,918
The dirty bum, bum
bum, bum, bum

88
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:24,375
The dirty bum, bum
bum, bum, bum

89
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,458
They had it comin'
They had it comin'

90
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,243
They had it comin'
They had it comin'

91
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:31,704
They had it comin'
They had it coming all along

92
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,800
'Cause if they used us
and they abused us

93
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,352
How could you tell us
that we were wrong?

94
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:41,718
He had it coming
He had it coming

95
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:45,330
He only had himself to blame

96
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,400
If you had been there
If you had seen it

97
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,769
I betcha you would
have done the same

98
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:54,680
You pop that gum one more time...
Ten times.

99
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:58,649
Number seventeen, the spread eagle.
Artistic differences.

100
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:00,304
Pop.

101
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,165
Six.

102
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,272
Squish.

103
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:05,936
Uh-uh.

104
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,178
Cicero.

105
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,037
Lipschitz.

106
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,744
Who belongs to them?
What is it to you?

107
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,394
Nothing, I heard
they were Velma's.

108
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:25,107
Yeah, the Hunyak does all
her laundry for a buck a week.

109
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,307
Fresh towels for the can.
Make it quick.

110
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,533
Hear me out on this.

111
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,771
Now Billy Flynn's set your
trial date for March fifth.

112
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:51,226
March seventh you'll be acquitted. March
eighth, you know what Mama's gonna do?

113
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,096
Gonna put you back on vaudeville.
So now you're an agent too?

114
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:57,943
Well, dearie, until Ma Bell installs
a private line in your cell...

115
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,238
...all calls are gonna go through me.
What dough are we talking about?

116
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:02,962
You know, it 's a crazy world.

117
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:06,579
I mean, Babe Ruth is wearing rouge and
playing the Palace for five thousand  a week.

118
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:08,913
Yeah. And what about
someone with real talent?

119
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,738
Well, I been talking to the
boys over William Morris.

120
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,957
And due to your recent activities,
they think they can get you twenty five hundred.

121
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:19,898
twenty five hundred? Jeez, the most me and
Veronica ever made was three fifty.

122
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:22,231
Well, that 's what happens when
you have the right representation.

123
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:26,422
You know what, Mama, I always
wanted to play Big Jim Colisimo's.

124
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,594
Do you think you could get me that?
Big Jim's?

125
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:32,505
Jeez, I don't know. It 's gonna
take another phone call.

126
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,569
How much is that gonna cost?
Come on, Vel.

127
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:38,641
I feel about you. You're like family
to me. You're like one of my own.

128
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,995
I'll do it for fifty bucks.
Fifty bucks for a phone call?

129
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:46,323
You must have got a lot of
wrong numbers, Mama.

130
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:55,192
Miss Kelly, got your personals.
Freshly pressed by yours truly.

131
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,527
No, no. It 's my pleasure.

132
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:01,817
Hey, listen.
Can I ask you something?

133
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:05,849
You know that Harrison guy? He said
that what I done is a hanging case...

134
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:09,011
and that he's prepared to ask
for the maximum penalty.

135
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:12,308
Yeah? So?
So, I'm scared.

136
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:16,086
I sure would appreciate some
advice, I mean, especially from...

137
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:20,791
someone I admire as much as you.
I always wanted to be on the stage.

138
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:23,410
Really? What 's your talent?
Washing and drying?

139
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:27,384
No, no, no.
I danced in a chorus.

140
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,614
That was before I met my husband.
Look, honey, you want some advice?

141
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:36,595
Here it is, direct from me to you. Keep
your paws off my underwear, okay?

142
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,047
Yeah, okay.

143
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,708
Thanks...

144
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,734
...for nothing.
She's something, ain't she?

145
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:51,767
I tell you, no matter how big she
gets, she's still as common as ever.

146
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:54,196
I'd like to help you, dearie.

147
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:58,004
Take a load off.

148
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:02,614
So, what do you figure
on using for grounds?

149
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,700
Grounds?
What are you gonna tell the jury?

150
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:07,963
I figure I'd tell them the truth.
The truth?

151
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:11,544
One-way ticket to the death house.
Holy mother of God.

152
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:15,734
Relax. I mean, in this town,
murder is a form of entertainment.

153
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,228
Besides, in forty seven years Cook County
ain't never hung a woman yet.

154
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:22,588
So the odds are forty seven to one
that they won't hang you.

155
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:24,537
Jesus Mary Joseph.

156
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:27,962
You're talkin' to the wrong people.
What you need is Billy Flynn.

157
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,618
Who?
Billy Flynn.

158
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:33,269
He's only the best criminal
lawyer in all of Illinois.

159
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,608
Tell me what he don't know
about juries and women.

160
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,904
How do you get this Billy Flynn?
Well, not by praying, deary.

161
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:41,949
First, you give me a hundred dollars.
Then I'll make a phone call.

162
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:44,116
A hundred dollars? Well, you just...

163
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,579
I mean, it seems pretty
stiff for a phone call.

164
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:49,180
But it 's worth every cent.

165
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,048
I mean, he's never lost a case
for a female client yet.

166
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,734
And with a sweet little
puss like yours, well...

167
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:58,322
let 's just say justice ain't
so blind in Chicago.

168
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:00,980
He's never lost a case?
Never.

169
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,084
Every girl in this place would kill to
have Billy Flynn representing them.

170
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:14,429
We want Billy

171
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:21,491
B-l-DOUBLE L-Y

172
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:28,568
We're all his

173
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:34,613
He's our kind of a guy

174
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,628
And what luck

175
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:43,515
'Cause here he is

176
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:49,238
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting
the silver tongue, the prince.

177
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,128
The one, the only.

178
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,241
Billy Flynn!

179
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:03,478
I don't care about
expensive things

180
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,712
Cashmere coats, diamond rings

181
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:12,061
don't mean a thing
All I care about is love

182
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:14,291
That's what he's here for

183
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:17,212
I don't care for wearing
silk cravats

184
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:20,505
Ruby studs, satin spats

185
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,980
Don't mean a thing
All I care about is love

186
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:27,419
All he cares about is love

187
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:31,003
Give me two
eyes of blue

188
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,981
...softly saying
I need you

189
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:37,594
Let me see her
standin' there

190
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,304
and honest, mister,
I'm a millionaire

191
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:51,415
I don't care for
any fine attire

192
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,066
Vanderbilt might admire

193
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,573
No, no, not me
All I care about is love

194
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,717
All he cares about is love

195
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,917
Good morning, ladies.
Not guilty!

196
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,151
You tell him, sweetheart.

197
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,255
That's what he's here for

198
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,000
Excuse me. Do you remember
anything at all about that night?

199
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,916
I passed out completely, Miss
Sunshine. I can't remember a thing.

200
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,697
Only that I didn't do it.
Any idea who did, dear?

201
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:33,270
No. But my client offers a reward to
anyone with information about it.

202
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:35,446
How much is the reward, Miss Kelly?
I don't know, how much?

203
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,068
We'll work it out after the trial.
Now, if there are no more questions...

204
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:40,508
Miss Kelly and I have
a lot of work to do.

205
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,142
What's all this
about a reward?

206
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,929
Dumb reporters. They'll write it up
wrong, you deny the whole thing later.

207
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:49,556
Thank you!
One more question...

208
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,444
All he cares about is love

209
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,389
Mr. Flynn, I'm Roxie Hart.
Who?

210
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:58,301
Mama talked to you about me.
Yeah, right, right. The cute one.

211
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:02,143
I was hoping you might represent me.
You have five thousand dollars?

212
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,590
That 's a lot of money.

213
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,761
Mama didn't say anything
about five thousand dollars.

214
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,669
Look, Mr. Flynn... I'm not very
good at this sort of thing, but...

215
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,078
maybe we could make some sort
of arrangement between us.

216
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,443
And I can be an awfully
good sport.

217
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,386
Good, you got that out of
your system. Now listen...

218
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:27,774
you mean just one thing to me.
You call me when you got five thousand dollars.

219
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:31,446
All he cares about is love

220
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:34,746
Show me long raven hair

221
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:38,039
flowin' down, about to there

222
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,208
When I see her runnin' free

223
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:45,661
keep your money
that's enough for me

224
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,420
I don't care for
driving Packard cars

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,277
or smoking long buck cigars

226
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:57,942
No, no, not me

227
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:01,622
All I care about is
doin' the guy in

228
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,216
who's picking on you

229
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:09,021
Twisting the wrist
that's turning the screw

230
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:15,605
All I care about

231
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:22,202
is love

232
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:33,558
He'll see you now.

233
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,128
Well, hello, Andy.
Amos, my name is Amos.

234
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:42,492
That 's right. Take a seat.

235
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:46,743
You know, you're
a remarkable man.

236
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:49,596
Your wife two-times you, plugs the
guy and then tries to pin it on you.

237
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:53,142
Most men would let a dame like that
swing. But no, you're sticking by her.

238
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:57,467
Makes you a hero in my eyes.
That's right. I'm a hero.

239
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,770
Did you bring the money?

240
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,710
I didn't do as well
as I hoped, but...

241
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:05,084
I will, Mr. Flynn. I will.

242
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:10,047
This is only a thousand.
Plus there's tree hundred I borrowed...

243
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:14,649
from the guys down at the
garage, and there's seven hundred...

244
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:17,468
...from the building and loan fund.
Two thousand?

245
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,735
And that 's all I got so far.

246
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,425
But I'll give you twenty dollars off
my salary every week.

247
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,625
I'll give you notes with interest.
Double, triple, until it 's paid.

248
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:29,400
You came to me yesterday, I didn't
ask you if she's guilty or innocent.

249
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:32,663
I didn't ask you if she was
drunk or a dope fiend, no!

250
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,865
All I said was, "Do you have
five thousand dollars?" You said yes!

251
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,691
But you don't have five thousand dollars!

252
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:41,910
So I figure you're a dirty liar and I
don't waste my time with dirty liars!

253
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,283
Look...

254
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,321
I'm real sorry, Mr. Flynn.

255
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,320
On the other hand, your devotion
to your wife is really very touching.

256
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,805
I'll take your wife's case.
And I'll keep it.

257
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,330
Because I play square.

258
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,163
Now look, I don't like
to blow my own horn...

259
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,783
but believe me. If Jesus Christ
had lived in Chicago today...

260
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:12,124
and if he had five thousand dollars
and had come to me...

261
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,257
things would have
turned out differently.

262
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,981
All right, this is what we're gonna
do. By the end of the week...

263
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,895
I'm gonna have Roxie's name
on every newspaper in town.

264
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,360
Sweetest little jazz killer ever to hit
Chicago. That's the angle I'm after.

265
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:28,733
You make an announcement,
we're gonna have an auction!

266
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,718
Tell them we gotta raise
some money for her defense.

267
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:33,729
They'll buy everything she's
ever touched. Everything.

268
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:36,320
Your shoes, your dresses,
your perfumes, your underwear.

269
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:40,343
And Victrola records. Like the one I
was playing when I shot the bastard.

270
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:43,165
I didn't hear that.
Not that I didn't have grounds.

271
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:45,184
Hey, what are they?
That 's for when we go to trial.

272
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:49,240
Nobody is gonna care a lick what your
defense is unless they care about you.

273
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,125
So the first thing we gotta do is work
up some sympathy from the press.

274
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:53,980
And they are not all pushovers
like Mary Sunshine.

275
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,731
But there's one thing
they can never resist.

276
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,897
And that is
a reformed sinner.

277
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:02,782
Right. So tell me, what was
your favorite subject in school?

278
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,361
I was a real dummy.
Come on. There must be something.

279
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:08,930
I got high marks in
Courtesy and Hygiene.

280
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:11,359
Perfect, you wanted
to be a nun.

281
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,499
A nun?
Where were you born?

282
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,608
On a chicken farm
outside of Lubbock.

283
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:18,494
Beautiful Southern home, filled
with every luxury and refinement.

284
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:22,106
Where are your parents now?
Probably in their rocking chairs.

285
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,379
They're dead.
Family fortune was swept away.

286
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,717
You're educated at Sacred Heart.

287
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,941
Then you fell into a runaway marriage.
Left you miserable, alone, unhappy.

288
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,505
Of course, you got all swept up
in the mad whirl of the city.

289
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:37,212
Jazz, cabarets, liquor. You were
drawn like a moth to the flame.

290
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,832
A moth?
And now the mad whirl had ceased...

291
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:43,417
and you're a butterfly.
Crushed on a wheel!

292
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,986
Which is it?
Is it the moth or the butterfly?

293
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,856
You have sinned and you're sorry!
God, that 's beautiful!

294
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:54,014
Cut out God. Stay where
you're better acquainted.

295
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,856
Kid, when I'm through with you,
not only will you be acquitted...

296
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:01,368
every man on that jury will wanna
take you home to meet his mother.

297
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:04,091
I was born on a beautiful
Southern convent.

298
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,501
What?

299
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:08,546
Holy shit! I'll never
gonna get this straight!

300
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,292
Pipe down the swearing.
Look, from here on in...

301
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,979
you say nothing rougher than
Oh, dear. Now try again.

302
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:15,935
I was born on...

303
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:18,041
Come on, come on.

304
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,619
So I came up with some more
things to do on the witness stand.

305
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:50,496
I thought I'd get all teary-eyed
and ask for your handkerchief.

306
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:53,409
Then I thought I'd take
a peek at the jury like this...

307
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:56,254
and flash them a bit of thigh, huh?
What do you think?

308
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,331
Sounds great.

309
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:05,468
Hey, don't you wanna hear the rest?
Tomorrow, kiddo.

310
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,642
You're at the top of my list.

311
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:13,281
Well, well, well.
Sorry to be late, Mr. Flynn.

312
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:15,834
Hope you aren't too bored.

313
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:17,661
I like it.

314
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:21,955
I like it.

315
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:27,935
Hey, Pollyanna, I heard your
press conference is tomorrow.

316
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:31,613
Yeah, what is it to you?
Well, you wanted my advice, right?

317
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:37,595
Here it is, don't forget Billy Flinn's
number-one client is Billy Flynn.

318
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,963
Meaning what?

319
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:44,313
Meaning, don't let him
hog the spotlight.

320
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,386
You're the one
they paid to see.

321
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,539
Now remember, we can only
sell them one idea at a time.

322
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,326
I can still see him coming at me
with that awful look in his eyes.

323
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:58,110
And?
And we... both reached for the gun.

324
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,658
That 's right, you both reached
for the gun. Ready?

325
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,262
Yeah.

326
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,618
Thank you, gentlemen,
gentlemen, Miss Sunshine.

327
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,188
My client 's just entered
the plea of not guilty.

328
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:20,828
We look forward to a trial at the
earliest possible date. Any questions?

329
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:27,230
Miss Sunshine.
As you know, my paper is dry.

330
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:30,625
Do you have any advice for girls,
to avoid the life of jazz...

331
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:32,992
...and drink?
Absolutely, yes. Mrs. Hart feels that...

332
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:36,352
it was the tragic combination of liquor
and jazz which lead to...

333
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,331
...her downfall. Next question, please.
Ladies and gentlemen...

334
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,340
I'd just like to say how flattered I
am that you all came to see me.

335
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,922
Yeah, Mrs. Hart is very...
You see, I was a moth...

336
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:49,315
crushed on the wheel.
You know, a butterfly drawn to the...

337
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,309
I bet you wanna know
why I shot the bastard.

338
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,096
Shut up, dummy.

339
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,416
Mr. Billy Flynn in
The Press Conference Rag.

340
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:03,874
Notice how his mouth
never moves... almost.

341
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:07,555
Where'd you come from?
Mississippi

342
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,815
And your parents?
Very wealthy

343
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:13,979
Where are they now?
Six feet under

344
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:15,905
But she was granted
one more start.

345
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:17,628
The convent of
The Sacred Heart

346
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,743
When you get here?
Nineteen twenty

347
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:29,893
How old were you?

348
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:32,900
Don't remember
Then what happened?

349
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:36,029
I met Amos, and he
stole my heart away

350
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,052
Convinced me to elope one day

351
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:40,995
You poor dear, I can't believe
what you've been through.

352
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:44,386
A convent girl, a runaway marriage.
Now tell us, Roxie.

353
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,387
Who's Fred Casely?
My ex-boyfriend

354
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:51,713
Why'd you shoot him?
I was leaving

355
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,692
Was he angry?
Like a madman

356
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,332
Still I said, Fred, move along
She knew that she was doin' wrong

357
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:01,664
Then describe it
He came toward me

358
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,091
With a pistol?
From my bureau

359
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:08,384
Did you fight him?
Like a tiger

360
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:09,956
He had strength
and she had none

361
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,557
And yet we both
reached for the gun

362
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,205
Yes, yes, yes, we both
Yes, we both

363
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:17,057
Yes, we both reached for the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun

364
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,621
Yes, we both reached for the gun
For the gun

365
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:21,854
Yes, yes, yes, they both
Yes, they both

366
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,356
Yes, they both reached for the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun

367
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,754
Yes, they both reached for the gun
For the gun

368
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:30,907
Understandable
Understandable

369
00:22:31,303 --> 00:22:34,947
Yes, it's perfectly
understandable

370
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:39,235
Comprehensible
Comprehensible

371
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,594
Not a bit reprehensible

372
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:48,800
It's so defensible

373
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,768
How're you feeling?
Very frightened

374
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:56,098
Are you sorry?
Are you kidding?

375
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,334
What's your statement?
All I'd say is

376
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:02,843
Though my choo-choo jumped the track
I'd give my life to bring him back

377
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:04,702
And?
Stay away from

378
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,179
What?
Jazz and liquor

379
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:07,618
And?
And the men who

380
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,501
What?
Play for fun

381
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,263
And what?
That's the thought that

382
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:13,568
...came upon me
When?

383
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:15,523
When we both
reached for the gun

384
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,578
Understandable
Understandable

385
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,703
Yes, it's perfectly
understandable

386
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:28,796
Comprehensible
Comprehensible

387
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:32,228
Not a bit reprehensible

388
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:38,942
It's so defensible

389
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:45,980
Yes, yes, yes, they both

390
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:50,340
Yes, they both
Yes, they both reached for

391
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:52,607
Let me hear it!
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun

392
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,776
Yes, they both reached for the gun
For the gun

393
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:58,845
A little louder!
Yes, yes, yes, they both

394
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,771
Yes, they both
Yes, they both

395
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:04,862
For the gun, the gun, the gun
Yes, they both reached for the gun

396
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:06,303
Now you got it!

397
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:08,892
Yes, yes, yes, they both
Yes, they both

398
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:11,746
Yes, they both reached for the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun

399
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:14,977
Yes, they both reached for the gun
For the gun

400
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:17,379
Yes, yes, yes, they both
Yes, they both

401
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:23,740
Yes, they both reached for the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun

402
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:25,470
The gun, the gun, the gun

403
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:32,065
Both reached for the

404
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:37,405
gun

405
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:50,784
Move over Al Capone, the Windy City
has taken a new criminal to its heart.

406
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:53,667
The name on everybody's
lips is Roxie Hart.

407
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:56,962
The sweetest little lady ever
accused of murder in Chicago.

408
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,029
Women wanna look like her.
Fellows wanna go out with her.

409
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:04,061
Some little girls even wanna take
her home. Don't get any ideas, lady.

410
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:08,413
On the other side of town, the D.A.
Promises the little sharpshooter...

411
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:10,820
will swing before
the year is out.

412
00:25:11,016 --> 00:25:13,951
Who knows? If he lives up
to his word assistant D.A. Harrison...

413
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:16,705
might become
governor Harrison someday.

414
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,728
At the scene of the crime, everybody
wants a little piece of Roxie Hart.

415
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:26,429
This jar of cold cream set
her husband back 20 dollars!

416
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:30,462
Maybe this pretty little lady would
get some of that famous Roxie style.

417
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:35,367
It seems everybody these days
is rooting for Roxie Hart.

418
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:40,836
Take those flowers to the orphanage,
make sure they know who sent them.

419
00:25:43,016 --> 00:25:47,489
So, kiddo, given any thought to what
you wanna do after Billy get you off?

420
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:51,005
Yeah, I think I'd like to go on stage.
I figured as much.

421
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:56,386
I already called the Morris office.
Really? How much is that gonna cost?

422
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:59,519
A fairly deal,
ten percent of all your takings.

423
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:03,998
Yeah, we'll see, Mama. Besides,
I don't even have an act yet.

424
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:07,648
Killing Fred Casely was your act. It 's
all the stiffs in the audience want...

425
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:10,784
...to say they saw somebody famous.
That 's a freak act.

426
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:14,498
And besides,
I am better than that.

427
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:18,690
Of course you are, cupcake. I mean,
you could be as big as Sophie Tucker.

428
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,990
You really think so?
Bigger than Cantor and Jolson.

429
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:25,054
You know, I always wanted to
have my name in all the papers.

430
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:29,758
Before I met Amos, I used to date
this well-to-do ugly bootlegger.

431
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:34,467
He used to take me out and show
me off. Ugly guys like to do that.

432
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:41,989
Once it said in the paper, "Gangland's
Al Capelli seen at Chez Vito...

433
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:46,080
with cute blonde chorine."
That was me.

434
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:48,743
I clipped and I saved it.

435
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:53,605
You know, all my life I
wanted to have my own act.

436
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:58,111
But no, no, no, always no.
They always turned me down.

437
00:26:58,313 --> 00:27:01,215
One big world full of no.

438
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:06,303
And then Amos came along.

439
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:10,152
Safe, sweet Amos.

440
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,224
Who never says no.

441
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:19,943
I've never done this before.

442
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:25,919
But it 's such a special night and
you are such a great audience!

443
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:32,543
And I just, I really feel like I
can talk to you, you know.

444
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,407
Forget what you've read in the papers
and what you've heard on the radio!

445
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:42,149
Because, because... because
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

446
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,769
Not that the truth
really matters.

447
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:49,065
But I'm gonna tell
you anyway.

448
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:56,960
On the bed department,
Amos was... zero.

449
00:27:58,538 --> 00:28:02,182
I mean, when he made
love to me, it was like...

450
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,931
it was like he was fixing
a carburetor or something.

451
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:08,136
I love you, honey.
I love you.

452
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:13,798
Anyway, I started
fooling around.

453
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,550
And then I started
screwing around.

454
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:20,358
Which is fooling around
without dinner.

455
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,920
Then I met Fred Casely, who said
that he could get me into vaudeville.

456
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,153
But that didn't quite work
out like I planned.

457
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:34,312
I guess it didn't really work
out too great for Fred either.

458
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:37,667
So I gave up on the whole
vaudeville idea.

459
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:40,616
Because you got to figure
after all those years...

460
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,486
opportunities just
passed you by.

461
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:49,352
But it ain't
No, no, no, well, it ain't

462
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:54,241
And now? Well, if this
Flynn guy gets me off...

463
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,265
and with all this publicity...

464
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:59,110
I got me a world full of yes!

465
00:28:59,595 --> 00:29:05,890
The name on everybody's
lips is gonna be Roxie

466
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:12,453
The lady raking in the
chips is gonna be Roxie

467
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:15,591
I'm gonna be a celebrity

468
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,267
That means, somebody
everyone knows

469
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:23,909
They're gonna recognize
my eyes, my hair

470
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:26,758
my teeth, my boobs, my nose

471
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:37,153
From just some dumb mechanic's
wife I'm gonna be Roxie

472
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:43,944
Who says that murder's
not an art?

473
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:47,751
And who in case
she doesn't hang

474
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:51,722
can say she started
with a bang?

475
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:56,066
Roxie Hart
