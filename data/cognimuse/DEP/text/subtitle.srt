1
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,917
Hey, you Billy Costigan?
Yeah, who wants to know?

2
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,879
Well, nothing. I know
a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

3
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,238
Yeah, that's my cousin.
Connected. Not too bright.

4
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,961
Yeah, I know.
I mean, no offense.

5
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:59,033
Billy?
Yeah, it's me.

6
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:01,999
Oh, my God. Good to see you.
Aunt Kathy, how are you?

7
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,039
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

8
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,192
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,556
I got kicked out,
like, four months ago.

10
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,837
Yeah, it was in the papers.

11
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,239
So you know.

12
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,120
And why are we graced
with your presence?

13
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,956
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

14
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:26,113
Look at the smile.
My mother had them. My

15
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:28,830
My mother's dead.

16
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,193
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

17
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,829
I was at a funeral myself, man.

18
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,836
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

19
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:43,119
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

20
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:45,351
You remember that. What a night.
Listen.

21
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,714
I got, like

22
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:52,191
thirty thousand bucks, right? Insurance money.
Yeah.

23
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:55,034
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

24
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,761
In your line of work, if I gave you

25
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:01,470
like, what, say, ten thousand,
what could I get back?

26
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,833
You know what you

27
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,231
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

28
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:11,360
What? What?
Come on, man.

29
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:15,230
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

30
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,993
What, you want me to say it?

31
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,399
I'm not a cop, all right?

32
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:27,550
I'm your fucking cousin.
You're bad.

33
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,399
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

34
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,917
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

35
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:39,471
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

36
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,957
R is for Ricans
P is for pigs

37
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,113
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

38
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:49,114
That's right. You used to be a cop.

39
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,552
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

40
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:56,031
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

41
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,600
This side of Worcester.

42
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:01,318
Says who?
Says him. Says Costello.

43
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,392
God says, as far as you're

44
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,315
concerned.

45
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,119
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

46
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:13,556
Cunt cop.
No, no, no.

47
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,360
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

48
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,910
Well, I knew his father.

49
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:21,669
I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
Jackie was all right.

50
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,230
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

51
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,278
Fucking guineas.

52
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,836
To Jackie.
Uncle Jackie.

53
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:31,992
Cranberry juice.

54
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,199
It's a natural diuretic.

55
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:38,433
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

56
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,396
What, do you got your period?

57
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:47,750
Fucking
Get off

58
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:54,270
Get your fucking hands off me!
Hey. Hey, hey.

59
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:57,234
Do you know me?

60
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:59,199
No. No.

61
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,394
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit

62
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:05,472
and there's guys you can't.

63
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:07,552
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit

64
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,871
but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

65
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,601
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now

66
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,673
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

67
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:20,829
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

68
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:25,717
I fucking know you.
I know your family.

69
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:27,754
You make one more drug deal

70
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:30,640
with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours

71
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,961
and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

72
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,113
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

73
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:41,793
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

74
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:45,120
What are you drinking?

75
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:53,717
A cranberry juice.

76
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,037
What is it, your period?

77
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:03,078
Get him a cranberry juice.

78
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:11,277
Hey, fuckhead,
that's Jackie's nephew.

79
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:14,957
What? Oh, fucking what?

80
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,875
Get the fuck out of here.

81
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:21,640
Sorry I'm late.

82
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:24,634
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

83
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,314
His undercover work is extensive.

84
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,631
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

85
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,917
Okay, my people are out there.

86
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,549
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

87
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:36,030
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

88
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,920
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

89
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:41,914
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

90
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:44,231
Fuck yourself.
I'm tired from fucking your wife.

91
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,596
How's your mother?
Tired from fucking my father.

92
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,514
Good. Today, girls

93
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,478
what I have is microprocessors.

94
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:54,792
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole twenty microprocessors

95
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,429
from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route one twenty eight.

96
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:59,751
These are the kind
they put into computers

97
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:02,640
that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel

98
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:04,553
from a couple hundred miles away.

99
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:07,440
These pieces of plastic are worth
about a hundred grand a piece.

100
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,069
We got a guy working
for the company two months

101
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:13,039
walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday

102
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,192
has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday

103
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:17,636
but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

104
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,871
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

105
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,520
Southie projects.

106
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,241
What was his name, the departed?
Myles Kennefick.

107
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:27,313
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston

108
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,153
which happens to
South Boston?

109
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:32,233
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

110
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,473
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

111
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,189
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

112
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:41,714
We're here to nail Costello.

113
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:43,280
All right, look. We got a guy

114
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,875
says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

115
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,396
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

116
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,870
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

117
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,317
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the FBI.

118
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:58,070
Without asking for too many details, do
you have anyone in with Costello now?

119
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,716
Maybe. Maybe not.

120
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,519
Maybe fuck yourself.

121
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:04,911
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

122
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,912
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

123
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,639
You girls have a good day.

124
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,916
Normally he's a very nice guy.

125
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,878
Don't judge him
from this meeting alone.

126
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,878
Now, Mrs. Kennefick,
I knew your son.

127
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,713
I knew Myles.

128
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,600
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

129
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,831
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

130
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:30,879
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people

131
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,760
who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

132
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,680
Allegedly.

133
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,755
Allegedly.

134
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,276
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

135
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,318
But not the robbery.
That's not wrong.

136
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:44,472
He did something else wrong?

137
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,553
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

138
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,437
I mean, fuck yourself.

139
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:57,356
Did you get that?
Allegedly or fuck yourself?

140
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:00,831
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Different breed down here, sarge.

141
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,680
I need a cup of coffee.

142
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:19,036
You making a house call?

143
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,552
Have I seen you professionally?

144
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:25,077
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

145
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:28,756
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty

146
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:32,357
and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

147
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:36,196
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

148
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,953
I have an appointment on this floor.

149
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:41,477
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

150
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,632
I'm one more up.
Oh, fancy policeman.

151
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:45,792
Yeah, that's right, fancy.
Are you a statie?

152
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,998
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

153
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,389
Suffolk, nights?

154
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:53,314
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

155
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,837
When's the last time you checked?
Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

156
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,640
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

157
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:02,361
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

158
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:05,194
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

159
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:10,276
I'll stab someone in the heart with an
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

160
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,557
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

161
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,633
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

162
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,234
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

163
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:30,276
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

164
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,160
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't

165
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:36,358
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

166
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:39,513
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

167
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:40,909
All right, have a nice day.

168
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:43,793
Cut him here.

169
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,954
Bye bye.

170
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:50,990
Jerk ass!

171
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,721
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

172
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,271
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

173
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:00,274
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

174
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,830
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

175
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,913
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

176
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,230
I'm trying to help you.

177
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:10,711
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

178
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:14,191
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

179
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,671
See this guy? You see this guy? This
guy don't want you to have the money.

180
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:20,560
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

181
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,076
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

182
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:25,960
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

183
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:28,271
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

184
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,591
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

185
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:33,719
Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.
Know what I'm saying?

186
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:35,360
You fellas come from Providence?

187
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,477
It isn't any of your business,
is it, now?

188
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:40,075
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

189
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:52,558
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

190
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,430
Fuck!

191
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,638
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

192
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,592
Get out of here. Get out of here!

193
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,510
Now, you also do probation work, right?
That's right, I see violent offenders.

194
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:18,594
Oh, bad guys.
Not necessarily.

195
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,874
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck l'orange.

196
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,520
Was your meal okay?

197
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:30,194
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

198
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:33,637
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

199
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,833
I'm waiting for you
to make your move.

200
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,799
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

201
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,280
I don't even know what it is.

202
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,954
So what's it like having people
find themselves. . .

203
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,918
in your office all day long?

204
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:59,595
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

205
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,156
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

206
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,674
No, no, no.
No?

207
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,071
No, no, no.
No, I'm not on your couch.

208
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,477
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

209
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:11,994
Yeah, I do.

210
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:15,194
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

211
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:18,840
Who says I wanna see you again?

212
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,233
Don't you?

213
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,718
You should see your face.
Don't you?

214
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,280
Course I wanna see you again.

215
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,872
What Freud said about the Irish is

216
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,159
we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

217
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:39,311
Yeah, he said that.
I know he did.

218
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,518
So you're up shit's creek with
a client Iist full of mick cops.

219
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,592
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

220
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,831
Why do you do it, then?

221
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,037
Some people do get better.

222
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,195
Fair enough.

223
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:57,910
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

224
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,035
Including the criminals?

225
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:02,351
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

226
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:06,118
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

227
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,955
Wait. You are trouble.
You don't know the half of it.

228
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:12,112
I'll arrest you right now.

229
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:15,078
My word against yours.

230
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,474
then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you know who.

231
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,913
I say, Why not go to
Parents Without Partners?

232
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:26,120
He goes, Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners, so

233
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:30,990
So I say to him,
Princess Carolina of Monaco

234
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:34,875
Schuyler.

235
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,196
Do you know who I am?

236
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,754
No.

237
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:02,753
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

238
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,910
His real name Mr. French?

239
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,313
No.

240
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,672
Come with me.

241
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,119
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

242
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:39,512
You know something, they just do not
stop having the Mafia in Providence.

243
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:43,390
And this
can cause me a lot of problems.

244
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:51,914
Those guys you tuned up

245
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:54,151
they're connected down Providence.

246
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:56,954
What they're gonna do

247
00:14:57,121 --> 00:15:00,557
is come back with some guys
and kill you.

248
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:03,633
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

249
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,110
Unless I stop them.

250
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:08,238
Do you want me to stop them?

251
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,391
Is this something
I can't do personally?

252
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,839
I'm gonna have my associate
search you.

253
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,196
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

254
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:24,000
Contra fucking band.
Take your shoes off.

255
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:25,954
Shoes.

256
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:33,754
I knew your father.

257
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,794
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

258
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,474
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

259
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:47,159
Stand.
He didn't complain.

260
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,960
Yeah, that was his problem.

261
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,880
Who said he had a problem?

262
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,515
I just said he had a fucking problem.

263
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,991
There's a man could've been anything.

264
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,436
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

265
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:05,911
Fuck.
I'm saying he worked at the airport.

266
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:07,878
He's clean.
Arm.

267
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,235
Yeah, come on.

268
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,880
What arm? What fucking arm?

269
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,238
Show me your arm. Flip it.

270
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:24,151
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

271
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,075
He's clean.

272
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:30,392
And if I can slander my own
environment

273
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:34,190
it makes me sad, this regression.

274
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:39,116
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan

275
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:43,399
to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

276
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:46,396
I just can't know.

277
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:50,880
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

278
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:55,079
Are you still a cop?
No! No!

279
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:58,434
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

280
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,320
I am not a fucking cop!

281
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:06,917
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

282
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:10,118
Yes. Yes, yes.

283
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,157
All right, all right, all right.

284
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:16,040
You're okay. You'll be all right.

285
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:19,274
Get your hand taken care of.

286
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:24,678
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

287
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,391
As for our problem with Providence

288
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,874
let's not cry over spilled guinness

289
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,154
Who let
this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

290
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:45,473
Just kidding. How's your mother?

291
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:47,760
She's on her way out.

292
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,879
We all are. Act accordingly.

293
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:53,311
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

294
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,551
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

295
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:58,633
What's got you all hot and bothered?
Get in the car. You'll see.

296
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,035
Do you trust him?

297
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:03,835
Well, these days

298
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,034
who's reliable?

299
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:08,438
His Uncle Jackie was.

300
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,399
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

301
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,759
I'm reliable.

302
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:23,831
Arnold, you're one in a million.

303
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,561
Ten. Ten million.

304
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,995
What about your wife, Arnold?

305
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,914
Well, I thought she was.

306
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:38,039
She wasn't.

307
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:42,038
Well, she got reliable.

308
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,953
Don't you people
ever shut the fuck up?

309
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:50,037
Another county heard from.

310
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:51,873
One too many. She got a big mouth.

311
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,032
Answer this for me, will you?

312
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:17,437
The principles of detection tell me these
two gentlemen came from Providence.

313
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:21,150
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate you outta my crime scene.

314
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,960
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

315
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,520
Thanks.

316
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:31,758
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

317
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,639
Can I meet you for lunch?

318
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:35,029
All right, see you then.

319
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:40,999
Who's the lead detective?

320
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:43,880
Good. He's a lox.

321
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,594
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it

322
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,433
and he'll say so.

323
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:01,719
Look in his car, you'll find the gun that
did it, registered, official. Providence.

324
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,997
In the trunk
or the glove compartment?

325
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:07,197
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

326
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,795
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the six o'clock news.

327
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:16,189
No wonder you get ahead.

328
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:24,117
Have a seat, Bill.

329
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,830
Do you know John Lennon?

330
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:37,833
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

331
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,317
Lennon said

332
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,679
I'm an artist.

333
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:49,039
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it.

334
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:54,435
I tell you, Mr. Costello

335
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,718
I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

336
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:07,076
Smart-mouth.

337
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,798
Too bad.

338
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,156
If you'll indulge me

339
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:15,990
Now what?

340
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,272
Choir practice.

341
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:21,555
Choir practice

342
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,510
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is

343
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:33,236
a man could look at anything

344
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:34,999
and make something out of it.

345
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,560
For instance

346
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:39,030
I look at you and I think

347
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:42,230
What could I use you for?

348
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:46,073
Get rid of this.

349
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,674
French.

350
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:50,196
Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.

351
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:51,999
Maybe we could work something out.

352
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,952
Good.
And send this to his wife.

353
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:57,998
It was nice the way
you asked the guy

354
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,311
which hand he jerked off with.

355
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:02,320
I hope this do not shake Rita up.

356
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:05,990
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

357
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,440
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

358
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,192
We have to do it by phone.
I won 't do it

359
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,511
if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

360
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,990
You don't know what this is like.
Microprocessors.

361
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,356
Micro what?
Microprocessors.

362
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:29,274
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in twenty odd years

363
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:32,239
and Costello is selling them
military technology.

364
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:34,710
Microprocessors,
chips, computer parts.

365
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:36,997
Anybody says anything about
anything like that

366
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:38,150
you let us know.

367
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,077
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

368
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:46,633
Jimmy Pappas.

369
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,712
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

370
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,031
Jimmy had a rough month.

371
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:54,431
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail

372
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:57,673
and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

373
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,593
I believe it's been in the papers.

374
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,672
You seem quite happy
with that result.

375
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:05,719
It's a fucking result.

376
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:08,998
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

377
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:12,073
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

378
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:17,120
I think you are a cop, my son.

379
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:20,319
Where's your license?
What license?

380
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:23,279
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

381
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:26,433
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

382
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:29,877
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

383
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,475
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements

384
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:34,472
into Mr. Costello's area.

385
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:42,109
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

386
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:43,270
Hey.

387
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:46,389
That's Jimmy Bags.

388
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,995
He was rea-- I don't know.
What the fuck you doing?

389
00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:55,713
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

390
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,599
There's no profit,
I pay him two grand.

391
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,558
Then make more money.
This is America.

392
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:02,918
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

393
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:05,595
Make more money.
That's the spirit!

394
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,752
Oh, fuck.
Don't worry about it.

395
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:10,355
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

396
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:13,519
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

397
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:16,434
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

398
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:20,674
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim

399
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:22,476
Hi, Captain.

400
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:23,790
This crazy fuck

401
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,997
knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
So?

402
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:28,197
He was
He was reaching for his cigarettes.

403
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:31,080
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

404
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:32,435
He reached into his coat.

405
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,751
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

406
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:37,230
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

407
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:39,392
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

408
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,711
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU

409
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,155
which is the right thing.

410
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:45,835
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

411
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,152
Bottom line

412
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,312
we think we might have a problem.

413
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:53,234
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

414
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,150
Really?
Yeah, really.

415
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:59,516
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

416
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,149
No, no, not presently.

417
00:25:02,321 --> 00:25:03,720
But I'm working on that.

418
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,917
Here, Bill, this is for you.

419
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:10,031
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

420
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:13,557
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

421
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:16,520
You wait. We'll call you.

422
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,273
You got that?
Yeah, I got that.

423
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:21,239
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I got that.

424
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,959
Good.

425
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:26,198
Hi, Dad.

426
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:29,031
I got promoted. All right.

427
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,758
Excuse me for one second.

428
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,559
You know

429
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:54,036
if your father were alive

430
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,192
and saw you here sitting with me

431
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:58,511
let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

432
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:01,354
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

433
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:03,671
And he could do it

434
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:07,950
which is maybe something you
don't know about William Costigan Sr.

435
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:16,958
So he never? I mean, never?
No. No, no.

436
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:20,477
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

437
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:22,836
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

438
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:25,439
Your Uncle Jackie

439
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:30,152
he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

440
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:34,595
And I think about this.

441
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:42,835
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

442
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,399
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

443
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,517
School?

444
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:53,035
With all due respect, Mr. Costello

445
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:55,237
school is out.

446
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:58,594
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

447
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:01,515
Good day, Fathers.

448
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:05,514
Mr. Costello.
Good morning, Francis, good morning.

449
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,241
You recall our chat?

450
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,557
Little boys

451
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:14,954
sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth

452
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,836
I am as God made me.
Was that your rationale?

453
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:24,961
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

454
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:29,000
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

455
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,234
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

456
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:37,632
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

457
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,511
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

458
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,273
Pay them.

459
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:46,479
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

460
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:56,038
What do you got for me?
Uniform got him for suspended license.

461
00:27:56,201 --> 00:27:58,431
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation

462
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:00,478
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

463
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:03,075
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

464
00:28:03,241 --> 00:28:05,801
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

465
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:08,521
Who's the lawyer?
Didn't know the name. Just a number.

466
00:28:09,201 --> 00:28:10,554
Beeper number.

467
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,436
And the guy didn't show up?
No.

468
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,671
And he beeped him?
Twice.

469
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:23,076
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

470
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:25,311
What?
Turn the fucking camera off.

471
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:28,759
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

472
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,912
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

473
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:32,275
It's off?
You're good.

474
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:35,001
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

475
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,397
He can't do that.
He just did.

476
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:40,871
You my attorney?
What do you think?

477
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:43,912
Have you made statements
or phone calls

478
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:45,673
I need to be made aware of?

479
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:50,195
I beeped you.

480
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:53,353
The card they gave me. That's it.

481
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:56,797
That's it?
That's it.

482
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:01,234
You need to call your mother

483
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:03,596
tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

484
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,511
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

485
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:17,838
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

486
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:21,471
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

487
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:24,834
So make the call.

488
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:32,631
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me

489
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:36,521
just listen
to what I'm saying to you.

490
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:56,953
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

491
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:58,952
Sorry, yeah, I got held up.

492
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:03,239
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

493
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:07,358
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

494
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:09,193
Bye.

495
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:12,473
Everybody out. Move.
