1
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:03,226
Dad!

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,151
Daddy?

3
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,231
Barbara.

4
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:33,145
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

5
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,951
And I'll need more cotton rolls.
All right.

6
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:39,825
Hello, little fella.

7
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:45,110
Beauty, isn't he? l found that guy
struggling for life and l saved him.

8
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:47,342
Has that Novocaine kicked in yet?

9
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:52,386
Bubbles!

10
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:58,949
My bubbles.
He likes bubbles.

11
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:15,027
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

12
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:17,831
He's scared to death.
l want to go home.

13
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,504
Do you know where my dad is?

14
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:22,789
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

15
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:26,265
Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
Pet Palace.

16
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,944
Fish - O - Rama.
Mail order.

17
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,226
eBay.

18
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:31,746
Which one is it?
I'm from... the ocean.

19
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:34,062
The ocean!

20
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:38,110
He hasn't been decontaminated yet.
Jacques!

21
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:40,069
Clean him!

22
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,464
Ocean.

23
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:47,304
He is clean.

24
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,791
The big blue. What's it like?

25
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:55,306
Big and blue?

26
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:56,381
l knew it.

27
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:59,828
If there's anything you need,
ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

28
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:04,190
If I'm not around you can always
talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

29
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:07,230
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.

30
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:11,265
Can't hear you, Peach.
l said we got a live one.

31
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,862
What have we got?
Root canal.

32
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:16,863
It's not going to be pretty.

33
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,151
Clamp installed?

34
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:23,305
What did he use to open?
Glidden drill. He FAVORS that one.

35
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:25,303
l can't see, Flo.

36
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:30,071
The Schilder technique.
With a Hedstrom file.

37
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:32,586
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

38
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,505
It's got a teardrop cross section.
A Hedstrom.

39
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:38,106
K-Flex!
Hedstrom!

40
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,183
There l go. Little help. Over here.

41
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:41,830
I'll go deflate him.

42
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:45,903
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

43
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:49,302
The human mouth is a disgusting place.

44
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:53,591
Nigel.
What did l miss?

45
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,311
Root canal. It's a doozy.
What did he use to open?

46
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,223
Glidden drill.
He favors that.

47
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,463
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer
at the portal terminus.

48
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:04,350
Hello. Who's this?
New guy.

49
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:06,866
The dentist took him off the reef.
An outie.

50
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:09,830
From my neck of the woods?
Sorry if l took a snap at you.

51
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:11,709
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

52
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:16,263
No, no. Those aren't your fish.
They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

53
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:21,908
The picture broke. This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

54
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:26,065
Going to be eight this week. Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.

55
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,461
She's going to be here Friday
to pick you up.

56
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:30,270
You're her present.

57
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:32,305
It's our little secret.

58
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:36,704
Well, Mr Tucker, while that sets up,
I'm going to go see a man about a wallaby.

59
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,541
Darla!

60
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:43,068
What's wrong with her?
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

61
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:47,344
Poor Chuckles.
He was her present last year.

62
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,310
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

63
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,629
She's a fish killer.

64
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:58,021
l can't go with that girl.
l have to get back to my dad.

65
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,183
Daddy! Help me!
He's stuck.

66
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,029
Nobody touch him.

67
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:15,780
Can you help me?

68
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:19,148
No. You got yourself in there,
you can get yourself out.

69
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,826
Gill...
l just want to see him do it, okay?

70
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:25,302
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

71
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:28,145
l can't. l have a bad fin.

72
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:29,870
Never stopped me.

73
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,222
Just think about what you need to do.

74
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,989
Come on.

75
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:47,344
Perfect.

76
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:49,787
You did it.
Good squirming.

77
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:53,783
From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

78
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:55,544
Yeah.

79
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:58,749
I've seen that look before.
What are you thinking about?

80
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:03,508
I'm thinking... tonight we give
the kid a proper reception.

81
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,506
So, kid, you got a name or what?
Nemo.

82
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,025
I'm Nemo.

83
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:19,423
You going to eat that?

84
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,869
Careful of that hammer.

85
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:42,548
Dory.
Sea-Monkey has my money.

86
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:44,463
Wake up. Get up.

87
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,066
Come on.
Yes, I'm a natural blue.

88
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:48,744
Get up!

89
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:13,945
Wow. Dusty.

90
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,509
The mask. Where's the mask?

91
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:19,788
No! The mask! Get it!

92
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:32,790
Just keeps going on.

93
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,544
Echo!

94
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:37,547
What are you doing?
I've lost the mask.

95
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,463
Did you drop it?
You dropped it!

96
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,783
That was my only chance of
finding my son. Now it's gone.

97
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:48,221
Hey, Mr Grumpy Gills.

98
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:51,869
When you're down, know what to do?
l don't want to know.

99
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,988
Just keep swimming.

100
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,632
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

101
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,021
What do we do? We swim

102
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:00,909
Dory, no singing.

103
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:03,503
I love to swim

104
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:06,948
And when you want to swim
you want to...

105
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:09,910
I'm going to get stuck
with that song. It's in my head.

106
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:11,027
Sorry.

107
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,028
See anything?
Something's got me!

108
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:17,023
That was me.
Who's that?

109
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,342
Who could it be? It's me.

110
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:22,310
Are... are you my conscience?

111
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:24,908
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

112
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:27,825
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

113
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,584
Can't complain.
Good.

114
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:33,187
Now, Dory, l want you to tell me,
do you see anything?

115
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,945
l see a...

116
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,545
l see a light.
A light?

117
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:39,668
Yeah. Over there.

118
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:41,344
Hey, conscience, am l dead?

119
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:43,263
l see it, too.

120
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,988
What is it?

121
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,791
It's so pretty.

122
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:57,940
l...

123
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:00,546
I'm feeling... happy.

124
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:04,583
Which is a big deal for me.

125
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:06,071
l want to touch it.

126
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:09,866
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

127
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:11,908
I'm going to get you.

128
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,344
I'm going to swim with you.

129
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:18,344
I'm going to be your best friend

130
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,263
Good feeling's gone.

131
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,981
l can't see. l don't know where I'm going.

132
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:32,389
The mask!
What mask?

133
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:35,543
Okay. l can't see a thing.

134
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:39,468
Look. A mask.
Read it!

135
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:42,712
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it
a little closer. l need the light.

136
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:44,065
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it
a little closer. l need the light.

137
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:46,461
That's great. Keep it right there.

138
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:48,941
Just read it!
Okay, okay.

139
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:50,511
Mr Bossy.

140
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:52,944
P. Okay. P.

141
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,624
Sher...

142
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,149
P Sher... P Shirley...

143
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,711
P not Shirley.

144
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,584
The first line's P Sherman.

145
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:04,505
P Sherman doesn't make any sense.

146
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:05,627
Second line.

147
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,111
Forty two

148
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,828
Light, please.

149
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:15,427
Walla... Wallaby.

150
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,226
- The second line's Forty two Wallaby Way.
- Great.

151
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:23,190
Just finish up. Speed read. No pressure.

152
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,309
There's a lot of pressure!
Take a guess, with pressure.

153
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,701
Sydney. It's Sydney!
Duck!

154
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:34,462
I'm dead.

155
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:36,429
l died. I'm dead.

156
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:45,710
We did it, we did it

157
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:50,583
No eating here tonight,
eating here tonight

158
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,345
No no no eating here tonight,
you're on a diet

159
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:56,105
Dory. What did it say?
What did the mask say?

160
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,660
P Sherman, forty two Wallaby Way, Sydney.

161
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:02,108
l remembered what it said.
l forget things, but l remembered it.

162
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,944
P Sherman...
Where is that?

163
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:06,592
l don't know. But who cares?
l remembered.

164
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:11,586
P Sherman, forty two Wallaby Way, Sydney.
l remembered it again!

165
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:50,345
Follow me.

166
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:48,147
State your name.

167
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:49,631
Nemo.

168
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:51,430
Brother Bloat, proceed.

169
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:56,622
Nemo. Newcomer of orange and white.

170
00:11:56,712 --> 00:12:00,830
You have been called forth to
the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie

171
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:05,349
to join with us
in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

172
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,108
We want you in our club, kid.
Really?

173
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:12,901
If you are able to swim through

174
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:16,348
the Ring of Fire!

175
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:23,628
Turn on the Ring of Fire.
You said you could do it.

176
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,509
The Ring of Fire!

177
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:29,428
Bubbles. Let me...

178
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:40,308
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy.

179
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:54,590
From this moment on,
you will now be known as... Sharkbait.

180
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,624
Welcome, brother Sharkbait.

181
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,147
Enough with the Sharkbait.

182
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:04,867
Sharkbait's one of us now.
Agreed.

183
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,149
We can't send him to his death.
Darla's coming in five days.

184
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,507
So what are we going to do?

185
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:15,025
I'll tell you. We're going to get him
out of here. We'll help him escape.

186
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,910
Escape? Really?
We're all going to escape.

187
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,347
Not another one
of your escape plans.

188
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,263
Sorry, but they never work.

189
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:26,061
Yeah, why should this be any different?
Cos we've got him.

190
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,141
Me?

191
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:28,872
You see that filter?
Yeah.

192
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:32,468
You're the only one who can
get in and out of that thing.

193
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:36,386
We need you to take a pebble
inside there and jam the gears.

194
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:40,147
You do that and this tank's going to get
filthier by the minute.

195
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:42,871
Soon the dentist
will have to clean the tank.

196
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:46,831
When he does, he'll take us out of the tank,
put us in individual baggies.

197
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:49,551
We'll roll down the counter,
out of the window,

198
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:53,466
off the awning, into the bushes,
across the street, into the harbour.

199
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,871
It's foolproof.

200
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:58,864
Who's with me?
l.

201
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:00,943
l think you're nuts.

202
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:03,751
No offence, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

203
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:06,471
He's fine. He can do this.

204
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:09,544
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?

205
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,031
Let's do it.

206
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:18,104
P Sherman, forty two Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?

207
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,581
To P Sherman,
Forty two Wallaby Way, Sydney.

208
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:22,822
If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.

209
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:27,986
P Sherman, forty two Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where? I'm sorry. l didn't hear you.

210
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:31,030
Excuse me.

211
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:33,421
Hi. Do you know how to get...? Hello?

212
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:36,106
Wait. Can you tell me..?

213
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,591
Hold it!

214
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:40,140
Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you.

215
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:42,188
Okay, fellas.
Come back here.

216
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:46,709
One quick question. l need to...
and they're gone again.

217
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,942
P Sherman, forty Wallaby Way, Sydney.

218
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:51,182
Why do l have to tell you again?

219
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:54,742
l don't get tired of it.
All right, here's the thing.

220
00:14:55,592 --> 00:15:00,063
l think it's best if l carry on from here by...

221
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:03,021
By myself.
Okay.

222
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,625
You know. Alone.

223
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:09,832
Without... well, not without you,
but l don't want you... with me.

224
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,470
l don't want to hurt you.

225
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:16,112
You want me to leave?
Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

226
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,581
l just can't afford any more delays.

227
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:21,505
You're one of those fish that cause delays.

228
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:24,550
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a group of fish.

229
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,749
They're delay fish.
You mean...

230
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,424
You mean you don't... like me?

231
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,150
No, of course l like you.

232
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:33,587
Because l like you
l don't want to be with you.

233
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:36,061
It's a complicated emotion.

234
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:39,381
Don't cry. l like you.

235
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,144
Hey, you.

236
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,462
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

237
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:47,340
l don't remember. Were you?
No, no. We're just...

238
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:49,263
Do you guys know how l can get...

239
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:51,547
We're talking to the lady, not you.

240
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:54,385
You like impressions?
Mm-hm.

241
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:57,225
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

242
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:58,870
What are we? Take a guess.

243
00:15:58,952 --> 00:16:02,501
I've seen one of those.
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

244
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:03,991
It's a swordfish.

245
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,792
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

246
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:06,622
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

247
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,711
Where's the butter?

248
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,862
It's on the tip of my tongue.
Lobster.

249
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,146
Saw that.
What?

250
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,223
Lots of legs.
Clam?

251
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:15,347
Close enough.

252
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,866
It's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad

253
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:20,989
They're good.
Would somebody give me directions?

254
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,108
Would somebody give me directions?

255
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:25,982
I'm serious.

256
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:29,190
Thank you.

257
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:31,388
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

258
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,672
What's the matter?

259
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:34,070
What's the matter?

260
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:36,222
While they're doing impressions,

261
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:39,941
l am miles from home with a fish
that can't even remember her own name.

262
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,671
How frustrating.
My son is out there.

263
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,583
Your son Chico?
Nemo.

264
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:48,142
It doesn't matter. Cos no fish
in this ocean is going to help me.

265
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:50,109
I'm helping you.

266
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:53,509
Wait right here.

267
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:56,583
Guys.
ls he bothering you again?

268
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:58,230
No, he's a good guy.

269
00:16:58,312 --> 00:16:59,192
Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio.

270
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,545
Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio.

271
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:03,066
Heard of P Sherman,
forty two Wallaby Way, Sydney?

272
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,382
Sydney? Oh, sure.

273
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:08,225
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
Don't you, Ted?

274
00:17:08,312 --> 00:17:10,912
Sure do.
Hey, they know Sydney!

275
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:15,028
You wouldn't know how to get there?
Follow the EAC.

276
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:17,751
That's East Australian Current.

277
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:20,949
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in...

278
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,147
that direction.

279
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:26,862
Then you got to follow that for about...
what do you guys think? Three leagues?

280
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:30,470
That baby's going to
float you right past Sydney.

281
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:31,985
That's great!

282
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:34,028
Dory, you did it.
Oh, please.

283
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,467
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

284
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,747
Fellas, thank you.
Don't mention it.

285
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:40,948
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

286
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:44,069
You guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

287
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:45,790
Ma'am. One more thing.
Yes?

288
00:17:45,872 --> 00:17:49,103
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

289
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:52,229
Trench. Through it.
Not over it. I'll remember.

290
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:57,663
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

291
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,141
Wait. I've got to tell you something.

292
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,304
Nice trench.

293
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:08,663
Hello!

294
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:14,540
Okay, let's go.
No, no. Bad trench.

295
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:18,420
We're going to swim over this thing.
Whoa, partner. Red flag going up.

296
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:21,424
Something's telling me
we should swim through it.

297
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:24,663
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written on it.

298
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,186
I'm sorry, but l think
we should swim through.

299
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,867
I'm done talking about this. Over we go.
Come on. Trust me on this.

300
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,864
Trust you?
Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

301
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:35,704
Something shiny!
Where?

302
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,545
It just swam over the trench. Come on.
Okay.

303
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:46,065
Boy, it sure is clear up here.
Exactly.

304
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:47,346
And look at that.

305
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:50,981
There's the current.
We should be there in no time.

306
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:54,144
Hey, little guy.
You wanted to go through the trench.

307
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:58,305
l shall call him Squishy and
he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

308
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,224
Come here, little Squishy.

309
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:06,261
Dory, that's a jellyfish.
Bad Squishy.

310
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:07,751
Get away.

311
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:09,584
Let me see.
Don't touch it.

312
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:12,140
I'm not going to touch it.
l just want to look.

313
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:13,950
How come it didn't sting you?

314
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:16,944
It did. Hold still.

315
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:21,469
l live in this anemone and I'm used to
these kind of stings. Come here.

316
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,463
You're going to be fine.

317
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:26,749
But now we know
that we don't want to touch these again.

318
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,187
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

319
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,429
Don't move.

320
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:36,272
This is bad, Dory.

321
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,625
This is bad, Dory.

322
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,390
You can't catch me.

323
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:45,940
Don't bounce on the tops. They will...

324
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,784
not sting you.

325
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:51,023
The tops don't sting you.
Two in a row. Beat that.

326
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:52,864
Listen to me. l have an idea.

327
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:54,590
A game.
A game?

328
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,151
l love games. Pick me.

329
00:19:56,232 --> 00:20:00,544
Here's the game. Whoever can hop
the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

330
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,270
Okay!
Rules.

331
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:04,627
Don't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

332
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:08,022
Something about tentacles. Got it.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

333
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,905
Wait!

334
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:11,432
Go faster if you want to win.

335
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:13,024
Go faster if you want to win.

336
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,348
Wait a minute.

337
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:22,384
So, we're cheating death now.

338
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,940
We're having fun at the same time.

339
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:26,704
l can do this. Just be careful.

340
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,023
Careful l don't make you cry when l win.
l don't think so.

341
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:36,189
Give it up. You can't fight evolution.
l was built for speed.

342
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:38,706
The question is, are you hungry?
Hungry?

343
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:41,750
Yeah. Cos you're about to eat my bubbles!

344
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:45,302
Duck to the left, back
and coming over... right there!

345
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:49,351
The clownfish is the winner.

346
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:51,787
We did it. Look at us!

347
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:57,095
Oh, no.

348
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:12,375
Am l disqualified?

349
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:14,657
You're doing fine.
You're winning.

350
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:17,302
You got to stay awake.
Where does P Sherman live?

351
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:20,419
P Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

352
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:21,696
That's it!

353
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,939
Stay awake.

354
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:37,535
Awake.
P Sherman...

355
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:40,822
Forty two Wallaby Way...

356
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,699
Wake up.
Sydney.

357
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:58,502
Nemo...

358
00:21:58,502 --> 00:22:01,302
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?
Yeah.

359
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:01,859
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?
Yeah.

360
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:05,491
Well, you're lucky to have someone
out there who's looking for you.

361
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:07,857
He's not looking for me.

362
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:10,172
He's scared of the ocean.

363
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:12,582
Peach? Any movement?

364
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:15,415
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's got to be soon.

365
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,299
Keep on him.

366
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:22,101
My first escape, landed on dental tools.

367
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:24,491
l was aiming for the toilet.
The toilet?

368
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:27,335
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

369
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:30,300
Wow. How many times
have you tried to get out?

370
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:35,172
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be
in a box, kid. It does things to you.

371
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,298
The bubbles!

372
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:41,261
Potty break! potty break! He just grabbed the
Reader's Digest. We have four point two minutes.

373
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:42,821
That's your cue.

374
00:22:42,902 --> 00:22:45,018
You can do it, kid.
We got to be quick.

375
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:45,422
Once you get in,
swim to the bottom of the chamber.

376
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:47,777
Once you get in,
swim to the bottom of the chamber.

377
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:50,501
I'll talk you through the rest.
Okay.

378
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,618
Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.

379
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:03,216
Nicely done. Can you hear me?
Yeah.

380
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:05,099
Here comes the pebble.

381
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,740
Now, do you see a small opening?

382
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:17,539
Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan.

383
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:21,900
Very carefully, wedge that pebble
into the fan to stop it turning.

384
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,541
Careful, Sharkbait.

385
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:30,090
l can't do it.
This isn't a good idea.

386
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:32,013
He'll be fine. Try again!

387
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:33,455
Okay.

388
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:37,300
That's it, Sharkbait.

389
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,577
Nice and steady.

390
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,575
l got it, l got it!
He did it.

391
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:47,734
That's great, kid.
Now swim up the tube and out.

392
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:06,493
Oh, no! Gill!

393
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:09,372
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

394
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:11,020
Help him!
What do we do?

395
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:14,331
Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

396
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:18,179
Help me!
Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

397
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:22,771
No!

398
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,659
Feed me more.
That's it.

399
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,778
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

400
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,218
l got it.
Pull!

401
00:24:37,662 --> 00:24:39,892
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

402
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:44,573
No. We're done.

403
00:24:58,022 --> 00:24:59,535
Dude?

404
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,540
Focus, dude.

405
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,490
Dude?

406
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:09,615
He lives. Hey, dude.

407
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,060
What happened?
l saw the whole thing, dude.

408
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:18,498
First you were all, like, whoa!
And then we were all, like, whoa!

409
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:21,699
Then you were, like, whoa...
What are you talking about?

410
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:28,255
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.

411
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:29,980
Awesome.

412
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,053
Oh, my stomach.

413
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:35,134
Man, no hurling on the shell.
l just waxed it.

414
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:39,538
So, Mr Turtle...
Dude, Mr Turtle is my father.

415
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,021
Name's Crush.

416
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:43,536
Crush? Really?

417
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:44,611
Okay, Crush.

418
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:48,012
Listen, l need to get to the
East Australian Current.

419
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:49,615
EAC?

420
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:51,135
Dude...

421
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:53,258
You're riding it, dude.

422
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:54,980
Check it out.

423
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:17,620
Okay, grab shell, dude.

424
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,462
Grab what?

425
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:19,894
Grab what?

426
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,853
Righteous!

427
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:36,975
So...

428
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,298
what brings you on this fine day
to the EAC?

429
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:44,340
Well, Dory and l need to get to Sydney.

430
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:46,572
Dory! ls she all right?

431
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:49,018
Oh, little blue.

432
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:50,979
She is sub-level, dude.

433
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:03,019
I'm so sorry.

434
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:06,095
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

435
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:09,219
twenty nine, thirty! Ready or not here l come!

436
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,255
There you are.

437
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:14,980
Catch me if you can.

438
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:25,062
Up you go.

439
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,256
Up you go.

440
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,541
Oh, my goodness.

441
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,615
Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

442
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:52,780
That was so cool.

443
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:55,501
Hey, Dad. Did you see that?
Did you see me?

444
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:59,575
Did you see what l did?
You so totally rock, Squirt.

445
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:01,220
Give me some fin.

446
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:02,337
Noggin.

447
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:03,980
Dude.

448
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:08,973
INTRO. Jellyman, Offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.

449
00:28:09,182 --> 00:28:12,299
Jellies? Sweet.
Totally.

450
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:15,579
Apparently, l must have done
something you liked... dudes.

451
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,937
You rock, dude.

452
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:20,658
Curl away, my son.

453
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,494
It's awesome, Jellyman.

454
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:25,938
When the little dudes are eggs
we leave them on a beach to hatch,

455
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:29,731
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find
their way back to the big ol' blue.

456
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:31,858
All by themselves?
Yeah!

457
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,661
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

458
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:38,781
You never really know, but when
they know, you'll know. You know?

459
00:28:43,462 --> 00:28:45,851
Hey, look everybody.
l know that dude.

460
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:47,853
It's the Jellyman.

461
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,536
Well go on. Jump on him.
Turtle pile!

462
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:52,374
Wait. Kids!

463
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:54,259
You funny?
Where's your shell?

464
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:56,776
Do your stripes come off?
l need to breathe.

465
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,092
Did you cross the jellyfish forest?

466
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,650
One at a time.
Mr Fish, did you die?

467
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,778
Sorry. l was vague on the details.

468
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:07,093
So where are you going?
You see, my son was taken.

469
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,377
My son was taken away from me.

470
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,013
No way.
What happened?

471
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:15,094
No, kids. l don't want to talk about it.

472
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:17,537
Come on.
Please.

473
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:20,091
Well, okay.

474
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:24,052
l live on this reef, a long way from here.

475
00:29:24,142 --> 00:29:26,212
This is going to be good.
l can tell.

476
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:30,693
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

477
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:34,821
Maybe he wouldn't have done it if l
hadn't been so tough on him. l don't know.

478
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,177
He swam in the open water
to this boat

479
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:40,652
and these divers appeared
and l tried to stop them.

480
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:43,415
The boat was too fast,
so we swam out in the ocean...

481
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:47,381
He couldn't stop them. Then Nemo's dad,
he swims out to the ocean

482
00:29:47,462 --> 00:29:49,657
and they bump into three sharks.

483
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:52,017
He scares them away
by blowing them up.

484
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:54,855
Amazing.
And then dives thousands of feet...

485
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:58,776
Down into the dark. It's wicked
dark there. You can't see a thing.

486
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,296
The only thing
they can see down there is...

487
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,931
This horrible creature with
razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

488
00:30:05,022 --> 00:30:06,614
He has to blast his way...

489
00:30:06,702 --> 00:30:11,139
These fish have been searching the ocean
for days on the East Australian Current.

490
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:13,417
He may be on his way here right now.

491
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:16,175
That puts him in Sydney Harbour...
ln a few days.

492
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:18,139
He's going to stop at nothing...
